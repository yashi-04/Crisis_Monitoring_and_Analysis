reddit,1jqf4yr,depression,2025-04-03 16:14:24,I stopped having depressions overnight. It wasn’t magic. It was structure.,"This will sound unbelievable, so I’ll keep it simple and honest.

I used to be depressed. For years. Same thoughts, same feelings, same weight. I’d reflect, analyze, try to find the “root cause.” I was smart, introspective, serious about understanding myself. But no matter how deeply I thought, I kept ending up in the same place.

One day, I realized something:

>I’m not merely thinking the same thought over and over. I’m following a chain of thoughts—and that chain always leads me back to the beginning.

That was the moment it hit me.  
I was thinking in a **loop**.

Each thought in the loop made sense. It logically followed from the previous one. And because it felt like progress, I never realized I was *orbiting*. I thought I was “processing” or “unpacking” something important. That I was about to uncover the root cause and stop having depressions altogether.

But I wasn’t solving anything. I was just repeating a structure.

Once I recognized that I was thinking in a loop, I had to ask:

>If I’ve gone through this loop hundreds—maybe thousands—of times, and never found relief… …then maybe the answer I’m looking for isn’t in the loop.

That insight didn’t “fix” me. It didn't make me tolerate the fact that I'm depressed. To live my life despite of depression. No, it just **ended the loop**.

I stopped engaging with it.  
And the depression stopped, too. **Overnight**.

Not because I changed my thoughts.  
Not because I fought them.  
But because I recognized that I could be searching in a limited―and wrong―set of thoughts.

Essentially, I recognized that I might be wasting my time with a circular chain of thoughts that didn't even contain the resolution.

A few things I learned:

* Thoughts aren’t random. They’re *led*. One implies the next.
* If that chain loops back, you’ll think you’re exploring—but you’re just orbiting.
* Depression (at least mine) wasn’t a feeling—it was the shape of a *system of thought*.
* Trying to replace “bad thoughts” just rearranges the loop.
* And believing I had “free will” in what I was thinking made it harder to see that I was being *carried* by the structure itself.

Once I saw it as structure, not identity, I stepped out of it.  
Effortlessly. And effortlessly in the strongest sense of the word: **It took no effort**.  
And I haven’t had a depression since. That was over 20 years ago.

I’m not claiming this applies to everyone.  
I’m just saying: for me, depression wasn’t something broken.  
It was introspective capacity misconfigured into a looping chain of thought.

And once I recognized that, it ended, and I could see what everyone else had told me ad nauseam: That my issue was a non-issue. I couldn't see it from within, but it became obvious when I left the loop.

If this clicks with even one person, I’ll write more.  
No theories, no positivity, no affirmations. Just honest structure from someone who got free.

reddit,1jqdoqn,depression,2025-04-03 14:41:20,"I am a Failure, by every definition of it.","For the last three years, I’ve been stuck in a cycle of procrastination, avoidance, and self-doubt. I kept telling myself I would change, that I would get serious, that I had time. But I didn’t. Time ran out. I failed a major exam—one I can’t retake. No second chances, no redemption, just failure staring me in the face.

Right now, I feel like I’ve thrown away years of my life. I had ambitions, big ones. I wanted to be disciplined, to push myself, to win. But instead, I let fear control me. I avoided the hard work. I wasted days, weeks, months, thinking “I’ll do it tomorrow.” Now there’s no tomorrow for this exam. Just the realization that I didn’t fight hard enough.

The worst part? I didn’t even give it my all. I didn’t fail because I tried my hardest and fell short—I failed because I was a coward. I let laziness, fear, and distraction dictate my actions. I ignored reality until it was too late. And now, I’m left with regret.

And honestly? It’s eating me alive. I’ve had suicidal thoughts because of this. I feel like I don’t deserve to keep going after wasting so much time. But at the same time, there’s still a small part of me that wants to fight, that wants to fix this and never let it happen again.

For those of you who’ve been in a place like this—where you’ve wasted years and had to rebuild from rock bottom—how did you do it? How do you go from being a lazy, inconsistent mess to someone who actually executes every single day? How do I make sure I never, ever end up here again?

reddit,1jqdeqa,depression,2025-04-03 14:22:31,Most people are disgusting jerks,"I'm a woman battling depression since my late teens. I've been on and about, and most days are incredibly hard just to get up and face public transportation, a job I hate, because I don't have the energy to do more than this, my will is to stay home and never have to deal with people again. 
Teen girls are the absolute worst, and I dealt with stupid girls who I thought were my friends. I still feel that people judge me because I'm quiet at my job or school. 
Today happened something that left me open mouthed: (note that I'm now a grown woman) some teen girl was laughing behind me on the train, saying to her friend: let me see if the gorilla gives me way. I'm a thin and tall, good-looking woman. It's just my arms that are a bit hairy, and I sweat a lot due to anxiety. I couldn't keep it to myself, and I started mimimiing her as she walked away. If people are like this to strangers, how do they treat their peers? It's disgusting. I was on a crowded train going to work, but this girl felt so comfortable in her little fckin cage. I actually feel complimented because I'm strong and firm and not weak and lacking morals and character like that little fart.I thought that today things were better with feminism and so many young militants. 
When I was a teen, I was respectful, kind, and smart, and unfortunately, I didn't respond to mean girls. I just cried alone in my room. Now I feel rage, and i say whatever I have to say without reservations.
I hate people who hate on other people, I've always gotten along with everyone and helped those in need.
Now, I fear most people, and my social life is a mess. 
It's not just teens, grown ass women make fools out of themselves too by doing this, and I don't have the energy for that behaviour: that says a lot about them. If people feel like they can do this, their life must be harder than mine, and they must have a deeper mental illness that they're too proud to admit. 
I used to be just a sad girl, but now I'm a sad and furious woman, and I don't blame those who lose their minds and start shooting their abusers. 
I've always loved culture and literature and reading the classics, but I don't have the nerve to be a teacher since I hate teens, and I guess I would just lose my mind. I'm at a tech job where I don't have to deal with people, but it's too robotic and definitely not my field (invoice quality). 
Everywhere I look, I see self-centered people who are judgemental and don't really care for each other. Is it just my depression? Where are the kind, smart, funny, and loving people?
My depression gets worse because there are no kind people in my life, or if there are, I don't get to see them or talk to them as much, and my job is so pointless and voided. I write poetry and draw because it's cathartic, and I've always considered myself an artist.
And I'm not that sad for me, I'm sad for the fact that we need to do this to each other, the root to everything we do and say, and I think about the meaning of all of this on a philosophical way, about human nature, and that everything is so pointless, you know? 

What's your opinion on this?

reddit,1jqcfjw,depression,2025-04-03 13:16:28,Life doesn’t feel worth living anymore,"Disclaimer: Long message ahead. 

I’ve not been doing emotionally well since the last couple of years. There were some hardships at home when I started dating a guy. After few months of dating, he turned into a physically abusive partner. I didn’t know how to deal with it or seek help. The first time I was scared and didn’t know what to do, but second time.. it became something I need to tackle (he ofc overpowered me), by third, it became something I’m used to.. and eventually you start believing maybe I deserved it. (Though I know I didn’t but because I ended up just trying to live with it). Finally, we broke up and I was emotionally trying to deal with the trauma and was very happy that relationship ended. 

I was in a new place that time so I was only starting to have a life there. 4 months post this I met someone in the office and we had an instant connection. I wasn’t ready to date anyone at that point and made it clear. He became my best friend and we eventually did end up dating. 6 months in and he wanted to marry me. I wasn’t ready, I was traumatised from my past, pressurised myself about the future to be perfect and .. then things started spiralling down. I knew the guy I was dating was actually pretty immature and irresponsible. Bur for me he started to change and became responsible. The only thing, he bought in marriage too quickly in us and wasn’t able to understand how much I was dealing with that time. I had some personal issues as well and the past abusive relationship was only a part. One day, during one of our fights, (I’m assuming he was also on an acid downer that day), we had a fight and that day things turned physically abusive with him. This time, I wasn’t going to take it. He knew about my past.. and I just feel instead of understanding me, he used it against me. I couldn’t call the cops, but I called up his parents (idk why but I still didn’t have the guts to call up the cops). That was the first time. He apologised like crazy and I know that he is not that kind of a guy so I forgave it. It happened again, but before that a bunch of things happened that triggered my trauma. I don’t have any memories from the past, but my trauma gets triggered. 
Eventually, I started loving him truly which I wasn’t able to do before because of my past trauma and anxiety. But by that time.. he had also been through a lot with me. He doesn’t communicate very well. And when he did, I was overwhelmed. And finally when we reached a point when we could, he had his defenses too high to see anything. He has never asked me about my trauma or understood how my responses were affected but instead blamed me for it. I didn’t receive the support I needed when I was trying MY LEVEL FUCKING BEST to do the right things to recover. Eventually he started saying things like I deserved it. He is an egoistic person and when people found out about few of the bad instances, he started lying to them. He wants me to accept things I didn’t do to satisfy the “public needs” that his people pleasing personality demands. I can’t. I won’t. When i haven’t done him this wrong, I won’t. 
We went on a break and got back together a year ago.. and I told him that this time I’ll fully invest and I’m aware of the issues I have and he wanted us to go for counselling. But that’s when I saw his behaviour being different. It was coming from an aggressive and power playing mind set. Now his intentions had changed though he may not have said it. But his actions proved it. I believed him to not be a shallow person, but.. he did things otherwise. I kept forgiving him.. because he asked for unconditional love which eventually became one sided. He kept thinking of how he was in pain a lot and instead of communicating about it, I’m blamed for it. Instead of talking which I had begged him for, he acknowledges sometimes that he didn’t handle some things maturely and just doesn’t show care. 
Cut to today, he said he doesn’t want anything to do with me. He took the last few months to made me miserable while I let him be my life. I was anyways not doing well emotionally and life with him felt like it had a purpose. Now it doesn’t. 

This makes me not want to live anymore. I’ve thought a lot about it. I know im a head strong person and can get through this phase.. but I’ve stopped seeing a point of any of it.  I don’t think I can do justice to myself or anyone else in my life after losing so much respect and happiness. I don’t have it in me to feel content anymore. Nothing makes me happy, nothing makes me feel content. 

I know it’s stupid but I try to tell myself that it’s not the worst, and there are people out there who have gone through worse. I know that if I want to live and get through this, I can. The only thing is.. I won’t be happy. I haven’t been happy in the last 6 years. And he was the only one that had given me any hope before absolutely destroying it. 

I have a supportive family and a supportive friend’s group as well. But internally, I am done. I’ve been in this cycle enough to emotionally exhaust me to a point I don’t find happiness in anything. I know there are a lot of things to do, explore. But nothing makes me want to exist.

trying to live with it Finally we broke up and I was emotionally trying to deal with the trauma and was very happy that relationship ended I was in a new place that time so I was only starting to have a life there 4 months post this I met someone in the office and we had an instant connection I wasn t ready to date anyone at that point and made it clear He became my best friend and we eventually did end up dating 6 months in and he wanted to marry me I wasn t ready I was traumatised from my past pressurised myself about the future to be perfect and then things started spiralling down I knew the guy I was dating was actually pretty immature and irresponsible Bur for me he started to change and became responsible The only thing he bought in marriage too quickly in us and wasn t able to understand how much I was dealing with that time I had some personal issues as well and the past abusive relationship was only a part One day during one of our fights I m assuming he was also on an acid downer that day we had a fight and that day things turned physically abusive with him This time I wasn t going to take it He knew about my past and I just feel instead of understanding me he used it against me I couldn t call the cops but I called up his parents idk why but I still didn t have the guts to call up the cops That was the first time He apologised like crazy and I know that he is not that kind of a guy so I forgave it It happened again but before that a bunch of things happened that triggered my trauma I don t have any memories from the past but my trauma gets triggered Eventually I started loving him truly which I wasn t able to do before because of my past trauma and anxiety But by that time he had also been through a lot with me He doesn t communicate very well And when he did I was overwhelmed And finally when we reached a point when we could he had his defenses too high to see anything He has never asked me about my trauma or understood how my responses were affected but instead blamed me for it I didn t receive the support I needed when I was trying MY LEVEL FUCKING BEST to do the right things to recover Eventually he started saying things like I deserved it He is an egoistic person and when people found out about few of the bad instances he started lying to them He wants me to accept things I didn t do to satisfy the public needs that his people pleasing personality demands I can t I won t When i haven t done him this wrong I won t We went on a break and got back together a year ago and I told him that this time I ll fully invest and I m aware of the issues I have and he wanted us to go for counselling But that s when I saw his behaviour being different It was coming from an aggressive and power playing mind set Now his intentions had changed though he may not have said it But his actions proved it I believed him to not be a shallow person but he did things otherwise I kept forgiving him because he asked for unconditional love which eventually became one sided He kept thinking of how he was in pain a lot and instead of communicating about it I m blamed for it Instead of talking which I had begged him for he acknowledges sometimes that he didn t handle some things maturely and just doesn t show care Cut to today he said he doesn t want anything to do with me He took the last few months to made me miserable while I let him be my life I was anyways not doing well emotionally and life with him felt like it had a purpose Now it doesn t This makes me not want to live anymore I ve thought a lot about it I know im a head strong person and can get through this phase but I ve stopped seeing a point of any of it I don t think I can do justice to myself or anyone else in my life after losing so much respect and happiness I don t have it in me to feel content anymore Nothing makes me happy nothing makes me feel content I know it s stupid but I try to tell myself that it s not the worst and there are people out there who have gone through worse I know that if I want to live and get through this I can The only thing is I won t be happy I haven t been happy in the last 6 years And he was the only one that had given me any hope before absolutely destroying it I have a supportive family and a supportive friend s group as well But internally I am done I ve been in this cycle enough to emotionally exhaust me to a point I don t find happiness in anything I know there are a lot of things to do explore But nothing makes me want to exist,1,1,a new place that time so I was only starting to have a life

I've written many research papers but never published and maybe they will once I leave existence for the next set of alive beings.

My kid died 1 year ago, my wife was 15 years ago, she took her own life and my kid suffered from a rare disease. The kid hurt me way more, because I was on a business trip and didn't think I wouldn't be back in time to take him home from the hospital - I ended up getting there too late even for the funeral.

I have a good salary, my job is very demanding, I'm mostly alone, most of the time.

I've got millions (usd) in the bank account, could travel anywhere in the world, eat whatever I want, do whatever I want, but the sadness creeps in sometimes.

I've written many research papers but never tried to publish any of them. I've never shared them with anyone and I honestly don't care about sharing my research, it is done for myself and not for other. I'm not sure many, or maybe anyone, would understand. It's not driven by ego, its driven by curiosity.

I've tackled every single problem I could find in the last 50 years and I've come with terms with every single one of them, with a solution I am happy with. Some I didn't solve and some I did. I always find it fascinating when someone else solves a problem that hasn't been solved before while I had but never published. I always read and sort of connect with how they solved it, the similarities and the differences are always fascinating.

I could retire if I want to, but I don't want to give up on humanity or on my existence in this universe. The quiet live just isn't for me, never has, and never will be.

I like to tell myself that I'm fine, but sometimes the sadness creeps in. It sucks that I've only met maybe 5-10 people in my life with the same mental capacity as me, and every single one of them are like me, in a sense it feels like we never grew up, that we are still a kid inside, curious about everything but with these fascination for complexity and turning impossible problems in a possibility. but, we are all loners. months go by without seeing anyone, just working in solitude and not speaking to anyone outside of work hours - there are multiple days where I don't say a single word all day.  
  
its been 15 years since I lost my wife and it doesn't hurt anymore, but my kid's death fucking hurts as that kid was nothing but great to me, not a single bad memory.  
  
Most of the times, the loneliness is very comfortable, but sometimes, on nights like these, it creeps in and let's me know it'll say for a while.   
  
Working feels good, it keeps me busy, it keeps my mind from remembering the good and the bad memories, the good and the bad in the world, the beautiful and the ugly. Too much beauty, too many good things and too many good memories can certainly unbalance a healthy mind in my experience, so work... just works, at least for me it does.  
  
I've traveled to pretty much every where I've ever wanted to go, I've got the time to attempt to solve every problem I ever wanted to face, I got to do everything I ever wanted to do and yet, I feel sad sometimes. thinking, i know what's the point, so why do I keep asking about something I've already explored from every single angle, do I do this to see if I missed something - and then rationalize why I am feeling that way.   
  
I've been to psychologists and psychiatrists, I've gotten massages, hugs, visited family, gone on dates - but nothing takes away the sadness that lurks from time to time.  
  
I sometimes like to tell myself that I own to humanity to keep fighting. Maybe it is what keeps me around, and maybe a little bit of curiosity of what will come next or when will happiness find me again, as it often does. I cherish the moments that I feel good. It mostly happens when I have a unique though or see something very beautiful I haven't seen before.  
  
Once everything has been seen and experienced, what is there to be done if not attempt to create novel, unseen sights and experiencing what wasn't available before? Seems only logical, yet hypothetical and not trivially executable.  
  
life is interesting, and for some reason, reminding myself that we are all made up of the same ""stuff"" as everything else helps me calm down - to re-frame the then distorted depressed view of reality into an amazing and epic journey. It doesn't always work, but talking about existence sometimes does.

I had fun during the journey and I am happy with where I am today, but it doesn't stop some lonely nights to punch me in my emotional stomach and puke in rainbow sadness, a color I like to think hasn't been imagine before, made to demonstrate the limitation of our own imagination.  
  
life is beautiful, but I don't always see it.   
  
I'll probably sleep and wake up feeling better, knowing very well that I can't cure every living being's body or mind from a much more horrific experience then my own - and that hunts me even when perhaps it shouldn't.

I hope I get better, sooner then later would be ideal, but not always is that the case.

Maybe feeling this way is a way to appreciate even more the times where these feelings aren't felt.

However and whatever all of this is, I know I won't quit, I won't quit on all of you and on all of us. Maybe saying this makes me feel better, but just know that this, it is true, no matter how I feel right now. 

Maybe that's what I needed in someone else, knowing that there is someone out there like me, that won't quit on you, even in their darkest hour.",depressed genius it is quite lonely today 155 iq and

reddit,1jq8rlv,depression,2025-04-03 09:30:07,Can’t seem to break out of a depressive cycle,"***Disclaimer***: I’m not actively suicidal, and I started therapy recently. 

I never had the most financially secure childhood. I switched schools multiple times throughout my childhood for financial reasons and after being bullied. I feel like I became an incredibly reserved and anxious person because of it. I rarely made friends that stuck around. One friend group made me feel like I was too different, like there was something wrong with me. But I was too afraid to leave them because I didn’t want to be seen physically alone. I reverted to self harm because it gave me a physical outlet for all the overwhelming feelings I had. Once I was in high school, I was eating lunch alone in the hallways feeling extremely isolated from my peers. Being alone in school just makes you feel like there’s something wrong with you, you know? And you can’t figure it out, so you just assume that it is everything you are that is wrong. I started having extremely self destructive thoughts.

I made an attempt at getting help in high school. I told my mom about my anxiety and how unmanageable it had become for me. After an appointment she made, which costed us 100 bucks, I started thinking about how much it would cost just to get therapy. So I refused to go because I didn’t want to be a financial burden to my mom. Especially not after we almost lost our house after the 2008 recession, not after she’d been the only person supporting us financially since my childhood, and not since we didn’t have health insurance. 

It also doesn’t help when you grew up with an alcoholic, absent father who gave no fucks about you as a child and emotionally abused you for his own benefit. Doesn’t even help now when his organs are paying the price for his addiction and he hasn’t changed and has no fucking clue why you won’t talk to him anymore. 

I don’t have a large friend group now. I spend the majority of my week alone. I go to class, then go home, that’s all. When I have ideas and want to do things to get out of the house, I’m too afraid to do them alone and when I ask the people in my life and I get told “I’m too busy” or “not now”, I feel like locking myself in my room and crying myself to sleep. I feel like the kind of person people in life go to when their first choices aren’t available for them. I feel like I’m only useful to people when they don’t want to be alone, not because they want to spend time with me. I feel like the only me people care to see is the one that is happy. I don’t feel good enough. I don’t feel like I matter. I frequently find myself daydreaming about leaving my hometown, and being on my own in another city. I just want to not feel lost anymore. I want to belong, I want to feel truly accepted and loved for all good and for all the fucked up that I am.

I find myself always returning to these thoughts when I feel depressed…always. I don’t know how to move past it. The craziest thing is that once I’m able to get past the lowest points, I feel like I was overreacting until the cycle starts all over again.

After all this venting, I just want to know what kinds of things have helped to anchor you down when you feel depressive thoughts trying to pull you down? How do you break out of this cycle? Has anyone been in a similar situation who’s been able to move past it? Any input is appreciated.

reddit,1jq86ja,depression,2025-04-03 08:59:31,How to trust myself again after self harming?,"This is something I desperately need advice on and something I can't find advice for anywhere.
People don't seem to talk about the fact that once you self harm for the first time everything completely changes. I think when I first did it my brains sort of went into a dissociative shock because we are naturally wired to want to avoid pain and injury and to value our lives but somehow my mind got to the point where I literally sat down and actively made the choice to cut my own skin.

I am past this now, it happened during the roughest time of my life and I didn't do it much but while not taking my anti-depressants properly | burnt myself really badly with a cigarette which has left a nasty scar and I cut my arm up for the first time in the same day (I had previously self harmed by cutting the tops of my fingers before). It was such a painful time and I'm not 100% sure why I did it. When I cut my fingers I think that was because I was annoyed at myself and wanted the marks to remind me how badly I want to change the way I am. And the cigarette was just because I hated myself so I didn't care what happened to me, and then when I cut my arm up that was after I suddenly stopped taking my antidepressants and I was super drunk so I don't have much memory but I genuinely think it was a desperate attempt to not commit suicide because I felt so pathetic and like the biggest loser ever and that the only thing I could do was attempt to release the pain by cutting or kill myself. Luckily I didn't die and I am very very happy I didn't kms.

I am in a very different place now but I worry that my brain will never be the same since self harming because the chemistry has changed or something and I can't perceive emotions as well as before. There's just something in me that feels numb although I feel emotions very deeply at the same time. An example though is how before I ever self harmed or even considered the possibility of doing it if I even thought about somebody self harming it would make me feel sick and horrified like a normal person.
Nowadays though I feel nothing towards it, I really want to and need to feel horrified by it again to make sure it never happens but I think then I would be horrified staring at my own arm and l'm not sure I can accept the level of what I did to myself.

My main problem is I feel like I have killed my inner child. The younger me feels like they have died now, I can't believe I did this to myself. I have so much guilt, I even hate myself for self harming. I feel like I can never be truly happy again because I am someone who has self harmed which is like the worst thing somebody could do to themselves apart from commit suicide I guess. I feel lonely. I feel unsafe with myself. How can I learn to trust myself again? To trust the person that hurt me, the person that hated me so much to do something I would never imaaine doina to anvone except myself. I feel like a monster to myself. How could I do this to myself. I was doing my best, all my problems weren't my fault they were normal self confidence problems and self control problems because of ADHD and somehow it led to sever delusion and body dysmorphia and self hate which then led to me cutting my own skin.

I need someone to help me believe that I can leave this in the past and see it as just a part of my life. I need help believing that my brain is not permanently fucked because of this. I am 100% confident I will never relapse again but I feel like the damage has been done and I feel unimaginable amounts of pain for the poor innocent happy child in me that thrived before people made me feel like a loser and I started hating the things that made me who I am.

reddit,1jq7q08,depression,2025-04-03 08:35:44,I didn't want to deal with my traumas.,"From an early age I guess I've been prone to depression but I never really wanted to or cared to deal with it. I have battle depression from as early as 11years of age when I still didn't know what it was. Now that I'm an I dealt, it's all starting to make sense, all the moments I would zone out, isolate myself and sometimes just stay so silent even in very harsh situations. All the broken relationships, not feeling any connections with anyone.

These things built me into someone that I thought would conquer any hardship. Unfortunately that is not the case as I fell into different addiction in my mind 20s and these seemed to work out very well because I actually got friends, a girlfriend, I was outgoing until I started working. The isolation quickly started kicking back in, the addictions stopped working, the silence came back, overthinking and just too much but I still found a way which was simply knocking myself out with drinks or cannabis. 

This didn't work as well I guess because I didn't actually even know that I was avoiding my traumas and I lost my first two jobs and I acted like I didn't care at all. Not until I lost my most current job is when I realised I was fighting something serious. At first I didn't really mind being fired because I was being treated poorly and the toxicity of the workplace but it hit me that for the first time I wanted some permanence and didn't actually want to deal with myself because I didn't only lose my job, I lost friends, my girlfriend, my home, independence and family couldn't help much, I started dealing with lots of uncomfortable memories to a point I had to ultimately stop using the addictions to numb the pain. All these have thrown me into a deep depression that I feel is too heavy to come out of and I want so badly to come out of it because it hurts and I need to do something about my life before it's too late. The traumas are eating me up alive, thought about ending it but never had the courage to. Anyway I just need an out and my mind is fixated on one solution ie a job with some kind of security.

reddit,1jq4m06,depression,2025-04-03 06:04:52,Depressed due to unsatisfied sexual experience with wife.,"Hi all, good day,

I’m 36 and have been married for 7 years. During my 20s-30s, I was sexually active with ex-partners and never experienced erection/climax issues. Before marriage, I didn’t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife.



In contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners/prostitutes before marriage, which heightened my sexual expectations. My wife was hesitant and timid about sex, which made intimacy challenging. During this time + currently, I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography (averaging twice daily), which has since escalated to rough contents (scat, spy etc...).



Over time, my wife and I developed better communication about sex, including watching porn together and discussing kinks. She is a wonderful partner, and we now want to start a family. However, I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused. She knows this. We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh.



I also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her, though she says she enjoys our intimacy. I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance. We use sex toys, lubes etc, but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others.

I’m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges.",Depressed due to unsatisfied sexual experience with wife Hi all good day I m 36 and have been married for 7 years During my 20s 30s I was sexually active with ex partners and never experienced erection climax issues Before marriage I didn t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife In contrast I had been involved with more experienced partners prostitutes before marriage which heightened my sexual expectations My wife was hesitant and timid about sex which made intimacy challenging During this time currently I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography averaging twice daily which has since escalated to rough contents scat spy etc Over time my wife and I developed better communication about sex including watching porn together and discussing kinks She is a wonderful partner and we now want to start a family However I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused She knows this We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh I also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her though she says she enjoys our intimacy I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance We use sex toys lubes etc but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others I m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges,0,1,"contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners",Initial-Parsley-8005,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jq4m06/depressed_due_to_unsatisfied_sexual_experience/,0.908,0.21766666666666662,Low,Positive

My dad just came back from the doctor. I'm not an expert, but I guess his heart isn't normal in some way, and he blames it on the stress that I cause him (which is probably true). So naturally, he does what's best for his heart and physical wellbeing, and yells his brains out at me as soon as he gets home. To be honest, I completely deserved it, but one thing that stood out to me, the same thing that stands out to me every time my dad gets angry at me, was how he blamed me for using my mental health to manipulate him. I promise you I do not overestimate myself or have an ego, quite the opposite actually, but I truly think that if 95% of other people were put into my position MENTALLY (meaning they have the same mental health issues and severities as me), they would handle it worse than I do. Nobody else, not even my parents, would believe me if I told them this, because my mental problems are 100x worse than what I express, because almost all of the time I'm able to hide my emotions and keep it a secret. Because of this, my parents think I'm just being lazy and not trying in life. Basically nobody knows how severe my condition actually is. Yes, I may manipulate my parents occasionally, but that is because my body has already been completely taken over by my thoughts. Most of the time they think I'm manipulating them ON PURPOSE / making my own situation worse, I'm actually doing the best I can, I just can't help it and my brain takes over. For example, the slightest things can trigger me, like if my parents give me a stern talking-to and a punishment,  I can develop suicidal thoughts. However, if I told my parents that I'm having suicidal thoughts, they would just think that I'm trying to use my mental illness to manipulate them and get out of trouble, but I'm not. My condition is just THAT bad, so i have to hold it in. In conclusion, I'm doing much worse than everyone else thinks, which means that I'm handling it much better than everyone else thinks.

Hello All, 

So things in my life are going really bad. I would say that I hate myself and feel I have no future. Nothing that's not my fault of course, but still. I've been suicidal before but, never quite like this I feel. I have been planning a note, googling methods in some detail and thinking of plans. Honestly I totally would just kill myself (I see it as a very elegant solution to all my problems), but my issue is that I actually have many friends and family who love me. My girlfriend committed suicide about 4 years ago now, and that experience really impressed upon me just how dramatic the effects of a suicide can be on loved ones. So I'm investigating some alternatives to killing myself. I am trying to get back in therapy, but I am worried that won't be enough.

 I have Viibryd. It's at 20mg, but it was prescribed to me like, many years ago by this point so I'm sure it's degraded somewhat and thus isn't the same effective dosage. I have been very paranoid about SSRI's. What are people's experiences with Viibryd in particular? Did it have any lasting side effects (like even after taking it)?  Did it help with suicidality or did it make it worse? 

I'm kinda desperate so really any and all thoughts are welcome.

I'm 25 years old and I've been depressed since I was 8, I know this because I've been in mental health care since my 8th because I confided in my parents I wanted to die really badly. Ever since then I've been to multiple kinds of therapy, psychiatrists, psychologists and it has been years and years of almost nonstop working on myself and working trough things with proffesionals. Alot has happened before my 8th which probably made me feel that way, and by the time I turned 18 I heard for the first time that it also runs in the family. 
But after my 8th more and more stuff kept happening in my life, when I was 8 I had a tough family-home life, lots of dysfunction, lots of things happening around an 8y/o that shouldn't have, by the time I was 12 I started hurting myself, making plans to end it all (all this time being in multiple types of therapy), at 13 I got put on meds, which turned me into a zombie so they got stopped once I turned 14 all the while the family disfunction was still majorly disfuntioning, around my 15th we suddenly very quickly moved to a faraway place, away from all the friends I had made trough the years, away from all that I had built up for myself, away from my home and heart. 
I was the only one of my siblings having to move with my parents because my brother and sister were older and had already moved out. The first months living in the new home it was winter and we didn't have any power, heating, shower, and all the basics, and I was too far away from my friends to be able to go over, I turned 16 in that house at the time we just had a makeshift shower in the middle of the living room, still no heating, no flooring, no one around me except for my new classmates, who I sadly couldn't connect with because I was so distraught and hurt from what happened. 
Few weeks after I turned 16 my mom suddenly up and left, mom and dad were arguing alot even before the move, but mom left cause she found out dad was cheating over the phone, dad was working all day so I was home alone a lot of the time there. Short while after that they started a divorce and one night I was broken up with over the phone by my then-boyfriend, through his best mate telling me, and to not contact him at all ever again, I was totally done with everything and messaged my ex: ""if you don't reply I will kill myself"" I know, very stupid. 
This made the cops show up at our door at 3pm, because ex had called them for a welfare check (I don't blame him for that), cops gave me an ultimatum: ""you either go into closed-assisted-monitored living right this moment, or you stay home and promise us you will be okay and safe"" I wanted to get the hell out of the house, so I stupidly chose to go for the first option. Days later I called my dad, remorseful of what I chose, we had a 5 hour conversation with 2 psychiatrists, my dad, and me, and I could leave the place on one condition: I could not live at my dad anymore, we had to find my mom and I had to come live with her. 
She lived at her mom's house (my grandma) by then, so I went there. After a few months we found an appartment, and after living there for a month, my grandma died, the one we lived with, my always favourite person ever, giving me and my mom a ton of survivors guilt, we felt responsible for her death cause of the stress we brought into the home. From my that moment (16-18) it was all a blur of smoking weed, hanging around with the wrong people, got 🍇d by 3 people I considered friends, all this time I was still in full time mental health care. I got an abusive bf, let him stay with me and my mom for 2 years, got into a special school for people that left school early, and broke up with the abusive bf at my 18½th, and I started a new relationship which would turn out to be mentally abusive too, although I didn't see that at the time. 
When I turned 19 I went to live on my own in a kind of student-frat house, that bf stayed over 1 night, 2 nights, and then never left my room, didn't have the guts to kick him out, love is blinding. That relationship sadly lasted for 4 years, way too long in hindsight, but hey, that's always 20/20.
Somewhere in the time I lived in this student-frat house my brother fell through a glass roof, breaking his neck and a ton of other bones, we were told really quickly to start planning a funeral since his chance of survival from this was almost non-existent, but by a fucking miracle he recovered, a month of induced coma, 2 months of recovery in the hospital, learning to walk, learning to talk, learning to remember, having tons of brain damage, having revalidation for months after that and again by a fucking miracle we got back almost all of him (he is even driving his car again now in 2025, still can't believe it).

When I turned 22 I finally broke up with this boyfriend that never left my room, one month after that the whole studenthouse got evicted, so I had to find a living place quickly. And with 5 days left until eviction, I found a room, albeit illegal living, but anything had to do. I got to subrent from a good friend of me and my siblings, he was a 50+ year old loner so to say, but the greatest sweetest guy you could ever meet. I got to live there for two years until I was 24 and a bit, and then he passed away from a heart attack, this hit hard, he had become my best friend in a way, my go-to for any issues, life advice, the person home when I was at my lowest, and one thing beside that: it meant we (also 2 housemates) had to move out within a month, again, while grieving the loss of our dearest friend and housemate. I found an appartment, 3 weeks after eviction, I got to stay at my sister in the meantime. 
In this appartment I recently turned 25, still in full time mental healthcare, grieving all of the above, I am now 1 month and counting clean of smoking weed, I am studying in a field I don't even know if I want to work in.


This was the huuuuge backstory, because the only reason I started writing this is because: I am SO done, still, and again.


I know I won't kill myself, I have gone through it too many times to even think about it. But here I am in my own home, which is too expensive but I don't want to lose it, I have been crying myself to sleep every night, and because I am at the one-month mark of stopping weed I get even more heavy vivid dreams than I've already always had (I never stopped dreaming even with the weed). 
I am acquiring debt but also working to make that go away. I am trying so hard to finish this study so my school debt will be that little bit smaller to pay off, and so I'll feel like I have achieved at least something.

But to be honest having so much years of uninterrupted depression is really heavy, and it's chipping away at me, constant healthcare, constant feelings of nothingness, constant new diagnoses, new bad things happening and a new thing since two years: anhedonia. 
I never thought 3 years ago I would've ever said this but: I'd much rather have manic episodes than feeling nothing at all, I used to have so many hobbies, so many interests, something could always make my day or life that 0.1% better or bearable, but now since a few years I just feel nothing.

But I will never say mental healthcare doesn't work, cause I know I would be way worse off (if not dead) if I hadn't had it. Starting medication again in a week, and to be fair I'm fucking scared, but it's really needed now.

reddit,1jq2duw,depression,2025-04-03 04:22:34,How to talk to parents about an emotional support animal,"
I am currently 22 and  studying in university.
 
I've been struggling with severe depression for years now and it affects every aspect of my life and is so insanely soul crushing. I'm especially destroyed by the loneliness, I'm unable to talk to people and have essentially no friends (I've been this way for a long time and there's no quick way for me to make friends. Not looking for help in this department). Anyways the main point is I feel a lot of my pain comes from my loneliness .  (Also I've been on medication for ~7 years now and have tried every one in the book and am currently on a cocktail of 3 different ones right now, but it's never been enough.)

It feels almost every week I'm fighting off suicidal thoughts, but overtime it's gotten harder and harder. Every aspect of my life suffers because of these feelings.

I genuinely believe with my whole heart that if I had an emotional support animal, it would make the world of a difference. Just having a creature to take care of, something so I'm not alone, a creature who I can love and interact with who will love and interact with me. I have been able to get pet mice and they make a world of a difference, maybe the only reason I'm still around. But unfortunately they very much are prey and although a few of them tolerate me and even like playing with my hand, theyre a far cry from an emotional support animal.

I absolutely qualify for one where I live. But here is the tricky part:

The house I live in is a student house,which my dad owns (so I only pay half rent). But because of that the landlord tenant agreement doesn't hold. And so if I did get a pet without his approval, he would kick me out. ( In my city rent for a room in a student house could be ~$700-1500) And so, that is obviously not worth it.

But my dad is not heartless, I think if he knew how lonely I felt, and that having a cat or another support animal would make me feel better he would understand.

However the last thing I want to do is tell my parents I feel this way. It will only make me feel worse. They have an idea about it as they know about the medications I'm on, but I always play it off and say it's mainly anxiety and nothing to worry about.

I really do not want to tell them how desperately alone I feel. Knowing them they will blame themselves and go out of their way to support me which would make me feel even worse and more like a burden so I am so incredibly hesitant upon doing that.

How can I go about talking to my dad about my need for an emotional support animal without:

a) seeming like I'm using it as an excuse to get a pet

b) open up entirely and change our relationship forever

I want to share my experience with depression, which I still struggle with today (this is probably a very long post, and I apologize if it bothers anyone or anything). I am 25 years old and have been like this for over 5 years. I also suffer from generalized anxiety and social anxiety. Lately, I've been thinking I might have ADHD or obsessive-compulsive disorder. I've lived most of my life alone, and I'm totally tired of it. I mean, on the one hand, I loved being alone because it gave me a bit of peace, but now it's like it's hitting me hard and hurts me a lot. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm a virgin, and I haven't even kissed anyone (I've even thought I'll never have one because of everything I'm going through and what will happen in my life). Currently, I have no friends and I live locked up in my house. I also don't currently have a job, and I'm trying to resume a university degree that I dropped because my mental health is seriously deteriorating.

When I was a lot younger (before the past three years) I had death anxiety, and was afraid of myself dying. I eventually in time didnt become afraid of it anymore. However since beginning of 2024 my death anxiety is coming back, but this time more so for my brother, hes perfectly healthy and all but I have this strange feeling like a premonition something bad will happen to him and that he will ...., im terrified of that happening, idk how I would cope if that did happen. These thoughts have felt 24/7. Last night I had a dream of him getting into a car crash, and it kept replaying over and over but slightly different each time because I would try my best to prevent it, almost like the anime ""The girl who leapt through time"" in a way for those who know. It made my chest really tight when I woke up as well.

In last year of HS so school work has been overwhelming asf, worrying about uni and shit. What I also hate is although I have a clear plan of what im doing after HS i still get so worried about the future, and the more I try to stop thinking about it the more I keep thinking about it.

All this and more has also been making me recently super restless. I cant sleep, and at times as well im afraid of not waking up when I do go to sleep so I try not to sleep all together. So death anxiety for myself has come back.

Ive tried some exercise practices for anxiety such as the 5 senses one or whatever its called, but works for about 10 - 30 seconds max. So most of the time Im just zoned out and scared by these thoughts most times of the day. 

About 3-4 people (I know personally) know I have anxiety and stress but they dont know these specifics that bother me. Thats becasue I also have this thinking that im not the only person with my only shit going on, I dont want to burden people with my problems when they probably got a lot to deal with already on their own. So because of that I dont open up about it.

Full disclosure: I (f20) have had many incidents since childhood of ""inappropriate touches"" by men mostly. Had completely lost my mental health during covid. Am very paranoid about people touching me in general and diagnosed with anxiety and depressive symptoms by a psychiatrist. Take medicine too. A psychologist also described me as having repetetive obsessive thoughts (the O from OCD) 

My college group thrust a really long task and it's ppt completely upon me yesterday cause I missed the last presentation (but still did all my work for it)
Did it alone through the night, didn't sleep.

Woke up, couldn't find my favourite bra for the third day. Started crying a little at the washing machine. 

my commute to college is around 1 -1½ hrs by car/auto and local train , with 4-6 hrs in college and 1 hr travelling back and I really want to be comfortable through this hell.My class starts at 7:30 am.

I asked my mom to cook me instant pasta for college. She is also recovering from surgery and is frustrated.
When I was leaving , I asked her to just give me whatever was cooked and she anuched into shouting /taunting at me 

Later I felt bad and I apologized to her in a message too.

2 classes later , 4 hrs in college the day wasn't really going bad.
We have to select our minor subject to study for next 3 yes and I wanted to ask a faculty from a certain department whoose program I am considering about it.

Find the older lady professor, grey hair old, probably 50-60 and she is from fashion design, and in a crowded room where some fashion couture ka photoshoot is going on.

She wants me to see a really well crafted top a student is wearing as an example. And all of a sudden I *feel fingers jabbing at my boob from the side*

I think oh ""she wanted to grab my arm and missed"" and instinctively moved away from her . She is looking away from me and towards the student 
She does *it a second time"" . I have trained myself to shove/hit/shout at men in these kinds of situation, but this was a female proffesor in full room and I *just froze and didn't raise my voice even* 

I moved away and she finally , without touching me, points out the student she wants me to see. 

I continue my discussion with her in a normal voice , but my panic had already started ATP.
I kept thinking ""*did she do it on purpose or am I over reacting ??"" "" Did she try to molest me "" ""Am I completely crazy for thinking a 60-70 yr old woman would try this ?""*

All of my trauma came back i think. 

Cried in the washroom, cried through the next class, left in the middle of class saying I am not well and came back home

And for the last two hours , I just lay in my bed and howled and cried my lungs out. *I hate men but I wanted to be held and sothed by a man, or even my mother so desparately*

Tldr : Have childhood trauma , sleep deprived , shitty morning ,  grey haired older female proffesor pokes /jabs fingers into my boobs twice , have a mental breakdown. Have I gone completely crazy and overreacting ?

reddit,1jqetew,anxiety,2025-04-03 15:54:19,I Thought I Was Handling Life Changes... Until Anxiety Hit,"2023 was a lot. Like, a lot a lot.

Fresh out of university, I thought I’d just slide into life like, “Okay cool, next phase.” But nope. Instead, it felt like I got hit with a truckload of change all at once. Job stuff, moving, figuring out life, relationship shifts, trying to start a side thing… all stacking up. At first, I didn’t even realize what was happening. I was just existing, moving from one thing to the next.

Then boom—anxiety, exhaustion, depressive episodes. I stopped taking care of myself. I was just tired all the time—mentally, physically, emotionally. And the wild part? My partner was going through it too. We were both just surviving, thinking, “Yeah, this is fine. Just a rough patch.”

It wasn’t until later, when we were talking about how crappy 2023 had been, that I realized how much I had been suppressing. My body had been releasing all this stress hormone because of so much change, even the good kind. It wasn’t a single thing; it was the compound effect of everything hitting me at once.

It took a while, but I started figuring out how to deal with it—slowing down, taking a step back, and focusing on what I could control. I had to let go of trying to control everything and just *be* sometimes. It still feels weird, but it’s helping. I’m learning how to rest without guilt, how to step away when I need to, and how to let myself feel.

reddit,1jqem6v,anxiety,2025-04-03 15:41:51,Anxiety and calf pain,"Hi all, I've been reading a few post lately related to how some people experienced pain/discomfort on their lower limbs due to anxiety. I wanted to share my experience and perhaps get some reassure from some of you that I'm not going crazy!

So for context, I've always struggled with stress and anxiety but my physical symptoms were always fairly mild. Fast forward to February 2020, while training, I strained both my calves and because the pandemic was just around the corner, struggle to properly heal as the physio offices closed for a while where I lived. All that to say is that since that initial injury, I've been sufferings from bilateral calf pain and my doctor and physio just don't seem to know exactly what is still wrong with them as they do no present any sign of injury or clear causes of pain. 

So for the past 4 years I've had pain in both calves, ranging from mild to sharp, from tingling, squeezing to burning, with no fixed location and jumping from one side to the other....I'm having difficulty focusing on something else and not moving my legs now and sleeping can sometime be complicated. 

  
I believe that I hold most of my tension and stress in my lower legs without noticing...Worst part is, I can still train and race by bike but there's always this constant dread and fear that I'll reinjure them. Basically every day  wake up not knowing how much it's going to hurt and where and for how long. I've had some time period where I could barely feel any pain and it was manageable but other where it just never seems like it will get better.

  
I've tried physio (which helps temporarily) and taking a break for months from all sport to maybe heal the injury (if it is) and nothing really worked...It's hard to see a sport physician where I live but my doctor doesn't think they'll find anything anyways.

  
So anyways, I'm thinking this is how I'll live the rest of my life now and honestly it's so depressing...Is there anyone who experienced something similar that was able to get ride or at least manage the symptoms to a degree where it doesn't occupy your every thought????

I had a situation with my partner that made me go into absolute panic mode couldn’t eat sleep or function it was all solved but not in my brain. My boss said maybe I should go on medication because i struggle to function in certain stressful scenarios years ago in my final year of school I was put on Prozac I didn’t remember it helping me much actually didn’t have a great effect on me i decided to go to the doctor she put me on lexapro.

At the moment I've been dealing with that almost constantly for weeks. It rarely lets up. My anxiety is a self-perpetuating death spiral around not being able to fall asleep.

Sometimes I go two nights without ANY sleep whatsoever and then crash for a pathetic 1 - 4 hours and then that cycle repeats itself. It's quite hard to find people experiencing the same thing.

Diazepam is sometimes helpful but doesn't do enough and I'm afraid of building dependency or tolerance. Mirtazapine and melatonin also no longer seem to be helping me.

I've been having weird episodes where I feel like it's hard to breathe out of nowhere, it only lasts less than a minute. Once you can get your breath, there's discomfort in the diaphragm. It hasn't done it in a few days luckily. I did have a weird episode yesterday morning where my heart rate went up out of nowhere and my heart felt like it was beating hard in my diaphragm area, I thought it was going to burst out of there. I took a nap and felt okay, but decided to go to the hospital for some heavy menstrual bleeding that just wouldn't stop. While I was in the ER, I felt fine laying there for the first few hours, and then the heart palpitations started and they were constant, the palpations kept turning into sinus tachycardia, and my stomach felt like it was tighting up every time it would do it. Like I'd feel fine for a moment and then it would do it again. It kept doing it off and on until they decided to admit me over night because they could see the flutters on the monitor.

I had heart palpitations all that night no matter what I did and my heart rate stayed elevated. After a clear EKG (the palpations never seem to do it during it) and a clear echocardiogram, the cardiologist came in and asked me some questions. Due to my age (36) and not having to many risks for heart problems (although, heart disease runs on my dad's side pretty badly), he didn't think a stress test was warranted and he wanted me to be sent home. The attending doctor originally thought about keeping me for a stress test the next day, but listened to the cardiologist. They wanted me to make an appointment with the cardiologist for next week for a holter monitor. He thinks the palpations could be due to my medication (Humira), the heavy period I was having, or maybe possibly acid reflux.

I really didn't want to leave the hospital and had a horrible sinking feeling in my gut when he said I'm fine to leave. When I left the hospital I felt okay, I hadn't had any palpitations for hours at that point. It didn't start back up until I ate and felt bloated. Now I'm lying here in bed at 3am with the worst anxiety over this and palpitations that won't stop. I wish I could have stayed in the hospital just in case something were to happen, even though I barely got any sleep there.

Inside the Storm: Living with Anxiety and Finding Control



My name is A.W., and at the time of writing this, I am 23 years old. I’ve dealt with anxiety since I was about 16, and over the years, I’ve experienced both the mental and physical toll it can take. The purpose of this paper is to share my experiences with anxiety in hopes that others who struggle with it can relate and feel less alone. If you’re reading this and going through something similar, I want you to know that you’re going to be okay. Many people deal with anxiety, and being open about it can help. Sometimes, hearing someone else’s story is the first step toward understanding and managing your own. I hope that as you read this, you’ll find comfort in knowing that these feelings don’t last forever—things will get better.

I’m not exactly sure how to start this—there’s a lot going through my mind, and I feel like I just want to dump all my thoughts onto the page at once. I guess that in itself might be relatable for some of you. Anxiety has a way of making thoughts spiral, and sometimes, sorting through them feels impossible. But instead of overthinking where to begin, I’ll just start with what I know: the physical symptoms.

Physically, anxiety has affected me in more ways than I can count. I’ve had full-blown panic attacks that left my limbs tingling—my fingertips, toes, forearms, even my lips and head. It’s a startling feeling, almost like losing control of your own body. When it first happened, I thought something was seriously wrong. I’ve also experienced heart palpitations so intense that I convinced myself I was having a heart attack. One of the worst episodes happened when I was 20. I had smoked weed, taken Adderall earlier in the day, and ended up in a full-blown panic attack while just trying to relax and watch my favorite TV shows. The combination of substances sent my heart racing, and in that moment, my body went into full panic mode. I ended up in the emergency room, completely sure that something was going to happen to me. Looking back, I know now that it was my body’s reaction to the heightened state of stress, combined with substances that intensified it. But at the time, logic didn’t matter. The fear felt real.

The thing about anxiety is that it doesn’t just stop at the physical symptoms. Once your body reacts, your mind follows, and suddenly, you’re trapped in a cycle. You feel something off—a headache, dizziness, a tight chest—and your mind immediately jumps to the worst possible conclusion. A simple headache becomes a brain tumor. A tight chest means a heart attack. The anxiety feeds itself, amplifying every sensation until you’re stuck in a battle between logic and fear. You tell yourself, *It’s just anxiety,* but your brain refuses to listen. It’s like your subconscious hijacks your rational thoughts, pushing you into full survival mode.

For the longest time, I felt like I was losing control. It was as if my body had become a prison, and my subconscious was the warden, keeping me locked inside my own fear. What I didn’t realize back then was that my subconscious wasn’t my enemy—it was actually trying to protect me. Anxiety, at its core, is a defense mechanism. It’s your brain’s way of responding to perceived threats, even when those threats aren’t real. Sometimes, those responses are triggered by past experiences—stressful or even traumatic events that were never fully processed. The subconscious holds onto those memories, reacting to anything that even slightly resembles them, whether you’re aware of it or not.

In a way, anxiety is preparation. Your mind is trying to shield you from something it believes is dangerous, even if that danger doesn’t exist in the present moment. But the problem is, you can’t live your life constantly preparing for the worst. At some point, you have to negotiate with that part of yourself. You have to acknowledge that your subconscious is trying to help, but also recognize that it’s working off old information—fears from the past that don’t apply to your current reality.

This is where self-awareness comes in. You might even find yourself talking to that anxious part of your mind, either out loud or in your thoughts. *Why are you making me feel this way? What are you trying to protect me from?* The more you listen, the more you start to understand. And once you understand, you can slowly begin to let go. Instead of fighting anxiety, you can work with it—allowing yourself to feel the raw emotions that your mind has been trying so hard to suppress. It’s not easy, and it doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s the first step toward regaining control.

Anxiety doesn’t define you. It doesn’t own you. And no matter how overwhelming it feels in the moment, it’s something you can work through. You are not alone in this, and most importantly, you are going to be okay.

Every time my actual performance is perfect but the terror that I put myself through in the time leading up to the event is exhausting. My fight or flight response is permanently active.

I want to know the degree to which I can still take 0.5mg of Alprazpolam and 10mg of Propanolol before an event.

reddit,1jqa5lq,anxiety,2025-04-03 10:49:32,How to deal with insecurity and anxiety,"Hello everyone! I’m 20 f and my potential partner is 25 male. I should say we’re not even IN a relationship yet, we’re just… getting to know each other. I’ll start by saying I have incredible anxiety. Also, I’ve never been intimate with anyone. I’ve kissed two people total- but each one time. I’ve never romantically held hands with someone.

He knows this- and I think he’s okay taking it slow. However he did say he’s been in several relationships in the past and he did mention having sex around 15 ish. I understand he didn’t know me, and that’s not really fair for me to be upset. I think I’m worried that he might not take it as seriously as I do since he’s been with people before.

I just don’t know how to bring up this topic because honestly I’ve only known him a few days- we’ve spent probably 20 hours on call and playing games together though. And I do think he likes me, I’m just… terrified. I really like him- and this is all so new to me. I’m so scared I’m going to mess up, or he’s going to change his mind on possibly being with me. Or if his ex’s were better then me, prettier, more fun, less exhausting. 

I do think I’m a good person, and there are things about me I think would draw in a loyal partner. I’m just SCARED. What if this isn’t it? What if I get my hopes up again and they get crushed? What if he doesn’t take sex as seriously as me? I mean- I don’t really want to be intimate unless it’s a ‘sure thing’. I’m not necessarily waiting for marriage, but I want one person to be my person. 

So for any more experienced people- have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn’t done anything? Does it bother you?

reddit,1jq9y7n,anxiety,2025-04-03 10:37:21,Has anyone else experienced this kind of panic attack “shutdown”?,"This is fairly new for me, it’s only happened a couple of times so far. When I have a really bad panic attack and start hyperventilating, I get extremely dizzy, and it feels like I’m about to pass out. Sometimes I’ll collapse if I’m standing, or my head will drop to the side like I fainted. But the strange part is, I don’t actually lose consciousness. When I “come back,” I’m disoriented for a moment, but I can remember everything that happened, which makes me think I wasn’t fully unconscious. It’s more like I go into a shutdown mode where my body just stops responding for a bit. It feels like my brain temporarily disconnects to protect me. When it’s over, it feels like I blacked out, but I know I was still somewhat aware. I couldn’t move or talk, but I could still hear what was going on around me. It felt like I was kinda paralyzed. 

If you’ve ever seen this happen to someone, the best thing to do is stay calm and remind them they’re safe. You don’t have to wake them up or panic, just sit with them until it passes. A soothing voice, holding their hand, or placing a cold object like a water bottle on their skin can help ground them. If they’re hyperventilating beforehand, slow deep breaths might help prevent the shutdown. It usually lasts between 30 seconds and 2 minutes. It’s scary, but it’s not dangerous. I think the first time it happened, I felt relief afterward when I came to, so my brain might’ve learned that “shutting down” helps me survive overwhelming anxiety. Now, it just happens as a coping response when things get too intense. It makes me feel like I’m insane or something. Like is it normal?? 

Has anyone else experienced this? Or does this sound like dissociation, a freeze response, or something else? I’d love to hear from others who relate.

I’m 16F, and I’m here to share a little hope surrounding debilitating death anxiety :) when I was around 12 years old,  there was not a single night I could peacefully sleep. I would lay in my bed, with this horrid feeling in my chest that either 1. I was going to die in my sleep or in some freak accident otherwise, and more troubling to me, 2. Fear of what was after death. It was pure and utter suffering that made me roll around and sob in my bed not knowing what the hell to do. The only thing that helped was putting on Disney music and just drowning out my awful, awful thoughts. I had always have anxiety around death; I had lucid dreams growing up and almost all of them was someone trying to kill me, or dreams about the afterlife itself. But thus period of my life was unlike no other. I had my parents coming in my room every night to try and sit with me for a few hours while I sobbed before they had to eventually go to sleep. My mom would show me videos of peoples near death experience to prove to me the afterlife was good. 

But I’m okay now (took about 6 months or so after the first occurrences?) :) I don’t think it’s useful to get into how, as it was my own personal process in coping and everything (though lmk in the comments if you’re curious!!!) I think sometimes it can be a little daunting that your anxiety might be really debilitating forever. But I believe in you, even if it’s awful right now, you will persevere. I have awful nights every once and a while, but I’m medicated (different from my coping, I wasn’t medicated till this year), and I have an awesome support system

reddit,1jq979r,anxiety,2025-04-03 09:53:47,Help with my anxiety,"M17, up until 7-8 months ago I’ve been a very extrovert kind of person. I loved going out and doing things, hanging out with tons of people, going to big events, etc. As soon as my senior year hit, my first day was just fine, made it through all my classes with no problems. This was my relaxed year and wasn’t nervous at all, knew almost all of my classmates, teachers, etc.  Second day rolls around and 10 minutes into this class I get very hot, start sweating profusely, vision blurs, and got very nauseous. I had to walk out of class to get to a bathroom, but the second I got to the bathroom I was fine. This repeated for a week. I had to get privately tutored at the school by an individual teacher for a single quarter(still felt nauseous but not so bad). They said that’s all they could do for me and I had to return to my regular classes, but my “sickness” never went away. I couldn’t stay in my classes, I can no longer go into crowded places, can’t go to events, even car rides with random people gets me sick. We went to Disneyland last week, we go every year, one of my favorite places to be, and couldn’t stand being there with all the people, the lines, and the anxiety build up to a ride. For the week I was there I primarily stayed in our hotel. 

When sleeping at a friends house or anothers, the second I start to sleep I get up to almost vomit, lean up, feel fine, and the process repeats until I finally get into a deep sleep. Its almost like feeling like your falling when sleeping, but replace the falling with the feeling of vomiting.

After leaving a high anxiety situation/sickness episode, I get flooded with deep and long burps, typically 5-8 of them and feel perfectly fine aftwerwards. I’m my normal self only when driving by myself, in my room, or sleeping, and anywhere else feels like hell. Again I’m a outdoors person, I hate being inside, and love being with lots of people, this issue has made me no longer someone I know. I’ve had to drop out of school for the time being, I’m nervous about getting a new job and being able to work with this, and scared I’ll never be able to be the person I was, I don’t feel like me. 

I had a CT scan done, they found nothing but a cyst that is “non-related” and wouldnt be the cause and happens to be a very common cyst that typically does not need treating. I had my blood drawn and said other than maybe taking some magnesium gummies, that I was perfectly fine. I’ve yet to go back in since then and that was 5-6 months ago. 

I can only self diagnose at this point, and I think that it’s anxiety but I’ve never had anxiety issues ever before, at all. Are these symptoms of anxiety? Is anyone else having these issues? Is there anybody that could potentially help? I’m just not who I am anymore and I can’t continue living like this.

My worry is stopping venlafaxine. It is supposed to be absolutely horrible especially after years of use, especially if using the ER version, especially at a higher dose (all me). As an experiment I opened my capsule last night and spilled just a few granules before closing again (I mean like 5%, so a 7mg difference which should be nothing) and man I am positive I felt it. 

 I am terrified I'm going to be absolutely miserable for weeks. I am going to ask my doctor for a very slow taper because there's no reason to rush. Still I think it will suck.

One of them being I feel like I’m running out of time and I truly believe this is my number one flaw. I’ve managed to “heal” or work on many of my issues but still feel anxious and realized it’s because I feel almost like my time is up on everything. 

Almost as if the world is gonna end or I’ll die or I’ll accomplish something too late but what is too late? Idk. This feeling is on me constantly. I’m embarrassed to admit I feel this feeling for the most silliest things. For example if there’s a place I want to go to, I have to go immediately or else I’ll be anxious about it or if there’s something I want to buy, I have to buy it NOW and if I can’t afford to I’ll type it on my notes app and continuously check on it. I use to feel this way about relationships like I need to date now or if I’m in one, I have to do a certain couples activity ASAP. I decided to stay single for a long time until I’m healed because I can’t handle a relationship with my disorder. I’ve also made peace that I may never date again which is ok, I replaced that feeling with hobbies. Felt the same way about my career/school which only hurt me along the way as I forced myself to apply to courses I didn’t want to simply because “if you don’t graduate now you’ll be too old and be poor forever” which only made me poor ironically.

My dad calls unhealthy anxiety “Anxiety” and normal, healthy anxiety “anxiety”. It is so debilitating, terrifying, all consuming, daunting, and just so so so fucked and nobody seems to get it. I don’t want anybody to feel sorry for me, or maybe I do idk. I just want somebody to share my pain I guess. Or maybe not share it, but understand it and be there with me. I have loved ones that try, but the only one that truly gets it is my dad. He goes through this shit too, and has been since he was my age, but he’s difficult to talk to at times. 

The doctors have had me on a rollercoaster of meds trying to level me out. I’m currently on Zoloft and busparin which seems to work most of the time, but as soon as I’m in a “triggering” situation (any situation that closely resembles that of my last panic attack), it kind of just doesn’t work at all lol. So they gave me klonopin for those situations, but it takes a fucking hour to kick in and feels like I’m in a constant state of “thousand yard stare” for hours. Don’t get me wrong, it works… but what kind of solution is that?

Idk I’m just tired. I have responsibilities, goals, aspirations, etc etc. and it just feels like I’m climbing a mountain with another mountain strapped to my back, and nobody can see it. I feel invalidated and alone despite being surrounded by people that love me. I don’t want love, I want them to understand my pain. That must be the most selfish thing in the world but idc honestly. I just want someone to look me in the eyes and validate my feelings. Fuck man it sucks. Thanks for tuning in to my rant

While I am still healing from clinical depression (been on anti depressants for 5 months) post my mom’s loss (my only parent), my lil brother has been pressurising me and creating emotional stress about his marriage. He wants me to lead his marriage matrimony searches and talks with the brides parents. I agreed to it because I love him and don’t want him to feel that there is no one for him. My elder brother is much more toxic person who blocked me after my mom’s death blaming me for various things which are completely untrue (hearsay from relatives). In India, when it comes to weddings, generally the inheritance talks come and both my brothers have decided to not give me 1/3rd share and all the documents are with them. They are following the age old patriarchal traditions in Hindu families where daughter doesn’t get property however laws change in India where daughters and sons get equal share. I am not in agreement with them but I did not want to take any legal action for next few years as I understand my brothers are going through sorrow from moms loss. However since my brother is asking me to be the lead his matrimony search and talk to brides parents , I am put in a tricky situation where I am not ok with the unequal inheritance but my brother told the brides parents that the house belongs to them (both my brothers). If in case the brides parents ask me directly I don’t know what to say about the property. My lil brother thinks if I don’t agree about inheritance,  brides parents will reject the match. My lil brother has been telling me that he is very sad that mom died and he needs to move on with his life so he wants to get married asap. I cannot lie to the brides parents either so I don’t know what to do. I confronted with my lil brother what should I answer if brides parents ask me directly about property. In fact I gave him multiple choice a) should I stay mum b) should I tell my opinion about 1/3rd share c) should I say we will com back later d) I lie that I agree with you. He started insinuating me why am I even asking such questions and making assumptions that brides parents will ask you directly. He says that I am trying to destroy his potential match but I have no such intention. I told him I am just confused and don’t know what role will I play. Out of anxiety I told him that inheritance is least of my worry because I can go legal and get my equal share be it after 10 years but I need to know what should I tell the brides parents. He told me he gets stressed if I utter the word legal and he wants all 3 of us to sit and talk but my elder brother blocked me everywhere and left me no room for discussion. Somehow it struck to me that my lil brother is trying to use me as a motherly figure for his wedding and at the same time expecting me to lie to brides parents about inheritance and also lose my rights. I love both my brothers a lot but I don’t know if this is the time to draw a line and stay away from them. They never call and ask me how I am doing despite knowing I am going through depression, diabetes and hypothyroidism. I am also trying to conceive and already at a very mature age for delivering babies. Honestly I just thought I want to share the stress I am going through here.

reddit,1jq3mn5,anxiety,2025-04-03 05:18:23,Is this Anxiety??,"Two months ago, I had an anxiety attack due to a cannabis edible.

I experienced Depersonalization/Derealization (DPDR) about 30 minutes after consuming the THC cookie. I was trapped in a DPDR state for 4 hours, essentially feeling like time wasn't passing and I was stuck in a time loop. Gradually, the sensation started to fade. I managed to vomit and then sleep.

The next day, I woke up feeling ""normal,"" but I felt different. At first, I thought it was just a hangover from the cannabis and assumed I would feel better in the coming days.

The anxiety gradually disappeared after two weeks from consuming the edible. However, I still feel different. It’s like when you stare into space and disconnect from the world, but this time, it lasts 24/7. I can still function ""normally"" (drive, work, watch TV, walk, go to the gym, etc.), but I feel like I’m disconnected. I’ve had this feeling before, but it used to only last for a few seconds—like I’d look off into space and then quickly return to the real world. Now, when I try to bring my mind back to reality, it simply doesn’t return. As I mentioned, I’m living my life normally except for this sensation, but it’s starting to bother me a bit (it’s been like this for 2 months).

Some things I’ve noticed during this period:

* My head feels like it's spinning inside my skull. I don’t feel dizzy, but it feels like my head is accelerated. 
* When I wake up in the morning, there’s a random song playing in my head. Yes, that’s right, a totally random tune.
* My sleep has become lighter since this incident (any noise wakes me up).
* My skin has become more sensitive. I believe it’s called ""burning skin."" I had an allergic reaction in the first few days after the edible, but the allergy passed. Now, when I scratch my skin, it feels irritated, and I have to scratch more.
* I’ve always bitten my nails, but now I’m doing it more than usual.
* I think I have ADHD, and it has worsened since this event.
* There’s a tinnitus in my head (not in my ears) when I lie down to sleep.
* My ears turn red and feel like they’re burning for no reason.

All of this is happening alongside the feeling of being disconnected from the environment.

**My question is:** Is this anxiety, dissociation, or some kind of neurological/stress-related problem? I’m asking because it’s been 2 months, and I’m still experiencing these symptoms. I’m considering seeking help, possibly taking an SSRI or an anxiolytic if this is indeed anxiety. I don’t feel mental anxiety—could it be physical anxiety?

I’ve had blood tests, an endoscopy, and a brain MRI, and everything came back normal. I also had a cortisol test, which was high (not above the limit, but close to the upper limit).

**Note:** I took Zoloft for 8 months (Dec 2023 to July 2024), and didn’t experience any side effects the first time I took it.

here’s a thread of my tweets in order when i was going thru a crash out just because i felt a lack of emotional security from my mom :

stupid ass defense mechanisms, it's so embarrassing to act unbothered and ""not care"" but internally ur deadass crippling from insecurity e haha fuck u idc if u don't care or pay attention to me (i care so much and it's driving me insane)
i'm out here hating and being mad while everyone else the unbothered ones bruh i hate caring ab ppl i hate hate hate
wtahx me shut myself out when i move u better fucking regret neglecting me when i'm gone (crayz core)
must i cry my eyes out for someone to make it look like they give a fuck liek man fuck u for making me vulnerable i fucking hate u, i got one week of treatment and now i feel neglected again, im so high mainatence but like yes i need constant reminders bro
kween just proved my point liek yeah i cannot be vulnerable haha it literally does nothing for shit
and u have the audacity to look at me like im such a horrible person for suddenly being moody, idk FIGURE UR FUCKING SHIT OUT i don't act out without having a reason dude but u lack the fucking thinking skills for that

right after : sorry gang i'm just rily upset n i don't actually mean all this
but im genuinely so upset

i feel like such a fool crawling around hugging ppl, like yes keeen physical touch is my love language but lately i've been so distant towards it, like i still go around hugging and cuddling but that's cus i wnana feel smth dawg, well fuck that shit no more hugs for u bruh

4 hours later : sorry i crashed out i actually love my family i js felt a moment of weakness cus of inadequate care, a second of feeling like im annoying and suddenly its the end of the world 😭

*end of threads*

— i always get like this when something upsets me and it’s so bothering cus i end up feeling so horrible for thinking the way that i did in the moment solely because i felt like i wasn’t loved, it could be as simple as not getting attention cus they would be attending to someone else, it’s genuinely caused such harm to my relationships. im glad i don’t verbally lash out, if anything it tends to be internal anger or i end up becoming super passive aggressive and hostile, like ignoring the person im upset with and etc

Words of encouragement, wisdom, or advice would be appreciated. I will take anything.

I’m in apartment style housing & am a senior.

What my role is like: I have 72 residents on my floor & I manage it alone. A new bulletin board, two social events, and a programming event is due every month & each needs to be logged into the school account with attendance. Every week I need to work 4 hours at the front desk (unpaid). I’ve completed 5 weekend duties and have 1 more to do & am on call every Wednesday.

How the living situation is: All my friends live off campus so I went the route of random roommates (mistake). They’re dirty and I always have to clean up after them. The door that leads into the main hallway from my bedroom is extremely thin & is across from the laundry room so I constantly hear the beeping of the machines and ppl passing to get to the elevator.

How it’s effecting my academics & mental heath: I’m taking 13 credits and am working on two senior projects. I skipped out on my spring break trip so that I could work in my hall for some extra money (for my cap & gown/nice attire for award ceremonies) & to focus on my astronomy class (I’m failing). Sleeping has been extremely difficult & I get an average of 4-5 hours a night. I’m starting to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. I went to class today in dirty clothes and didn’t even realize until I realized I smelled bad. On top of that, we are learning about multicultural competency and I ended up rambling and crying in class??? A white woman crying about systemic oppression in class while smelling like dirty laundry. Really cool of me.

I have no time to focus on securing a job or a house after graduation, nor any energy to do so. My boss is leaving for another job in 10 days so I don’t feel supported & don’t know how to ask for help.

I signed a contract that has me locked into my position. Graduation is in 44 days. My astronomy course is at a 60. I can’t sleep and I am living in filth.

reddit,1jqcx8q,mentalhealth,2025-04-03 13:49:37,I’m struggling with my mental health lately,"Lately I feel like my life is messed up. I only focus on my feelings and I can’t focus on other things that I like (reading, maths, physics, drawing, films and this kind of stuff). And also I don’t have any routine in my week or so.

I’m in my last year of university (I am studying two degrees at the same time in one of the most important university of my country, maths and physics, which is something I should be proud of and I love it but I only feel meh about it) planning doing a master to become a researcher in mathematical physics and then doing a PhD but I don’t feel good enough to do it.

Indeed I celebrate my birthday last weekend (24m) and I didn’t feel so happy, everyone came with many presents and were so happy (including my fuckbuddy, who gave me a present too). Honestly, I was a bit down. I don’t know if it was because I like my fuckbuddy and he didnt like me back or about I’m insecure of what master I’m gonna get into (I sent many applications and I got in a very prestigious one, but not my first option, I would know my first option in July) or about not reconnecting with my hobbies (I’m very curious guy and I want to learn so many things so I spent so many hours in Wikipedia when I was a kid but not this last years).

One thing I feel is that I lost my personality. Now I am completely different guy (I go to the gym, i am sociable blablabla) but I miss being a nerd knowing things and being a weirdo (some friends told me that I am still with books and films and some art things)

I have to say that I experienced bullying at school and I was sexually abused when I was 18 and 21 (not getting into any detailed of that). I guess that has influenced me in some kind of way but I don’t know really how.

I go to therapy but now I feel stuck on myself. I want to focus on the things I like. I don’t know if I am addicted sadness (?). I am not very self disciplined and I don’t know how to improve that or focus on my things rather than feelings (not saying not give them a space in my mind, but not ALL DAY). I only want to be better to myself and being comfortable with who I am. Only I want to be happy guy fulfilling his dreams and travelling around and learning new things. Or maybe the first thing I want to start is learning to focus on things, idk.

I’ve never used Reddit before, I made an account four years ago and I never used it. But recently I’ve been going down a spiral.
I fear that I may have some type of mental illness or disorder or something but my parents don’t think I do and aren’t too keen on helping me, and I’ve tried talking to someone or trying to find someone but nothing goes according to plan and it all ends up turning out as a mess. 

Recently my mood changes have been very very drastic and sudden and I feel like my emotions are controlling me more so than I am controlling them. I recently relapsed in terms of sh after months of being clean. I’ve also been much more irritated with everyone around me and I’ve found when I’m upset that I just thinking of every single bad thing they’ve done and I just begin to spiral about how much I hate them and I have all these terrible thoughts about them even if I don’t actually hate them. 
Along with the irritation-I’ve been feeling as if I’m ruining my relationships because of it, but I’m so genuinely terrified of losing my friends and those who are close to me to the point I’m having panic attacks and feel so insanely nauseous. I feel like a husk, if anything, I feel like there’s nothing inside of me and that nothing is real-i don’t have high hopes for the future-and all my days feel the same, I feel like I’m stuck and that I’m going crazy.

The thing is, my therapy sessions aren’t bad—my therapist is really easy to talk to, and we just chat about what’s been going on in my life. But it doesn’t feel like therapy. It just feels like talking to a friend. It’s not really helping me work through anything; it’s just another thing on my to-do list.

The weird part is, even though I don’t feel like I need these sessions, I still don’t want to drop them because I’d be cut from my meds and also because I’ve gotten attached to my therapist. She’s around my grandma’s age, and I never really had a decent grandma figure in my life, so in a way, she feels like the one I always wished I had. The only grandma that even comes close to comparing to her died almost 8 years ago. But I know that for her, this is just her job and I’m just another patient, and when I eventually stop therapy—whether because I no longer need meds or just don’t want to do it anymore—it’s going to suck. I don’t want to just disappear from her life, even though she would probably be happy for me that I don’t need their services anymore, but I also don’t want to keep doing something that feels like a chore just because I’m afraid of letting go.

I’m a big tall and often friendly dude but it’s the biggest lie in the world. It’s all a mask cause while I kinda hate the world I don’t gotta make it a worse place, folk deserve better. Anywho it’s given me fantastic people skills but I hate dealing with them. Turned me into a fantastic liar I guess (if I didn’t have a conscious id be a politician or lawyer lol)

I’ve done labor I’ve done bartending I’ve been a cashier and clerk and warehouse worker. I even did security being a bigger guy and all. Nothing sticks for long and I’m plagued with financial instability (actually 4k in credit card debt currently- and I live super frugal too and do everything to cut costs)

I just can’t keep up the mask and the tasks that long, usually 6-18 months or so.

Worst part is it’s not just jobs, it’s friends and hobbies. I’ve probably met a hundred new people in the past decade who I had a genuine good time being around and I always ghost them in the end. When I’m not forced to be around you I’m just not going to talk to you it feels like more work

They all say you have to find what you enjoy doing- and I get you don’t have to completely love it but that’s the problem. There’s just nothing that interests me or that I’m good at I can see myself doing in the long term.

In and out of therapy whole life which has never really helped, currently on Wellbutrin (apparent I’m one of the 3 people it kinda works for lol)

I’ve had the bad bad bad thoughts since I was 7 years old. If this is what life is, I just don’t want it. I don’t want a future I don’t want a family I don’t even really want a lot of money or a career but I need that to survive 

I’ve broken 13 bones, dropped out of college, and my longest relationship cheated on me. And capped out a couple years ago at 300lbs (actually lost 60lbs and am going to keep going down but it hasn’t made me feel any better, just pissed I let it get so bad in the first place.) My entire 20s have been miserable, hell my teens weren’t great either

Trying to do art or music just makes me want to physically trash my entire apartment, I know these things take practice but last time I tried to draw I clenched my teeth so hard I chipped a tooth. Tried teaching myself guitar and in just my first couple days I had an entire episode and drank myself to sleep for a month straight (thank goodness I’m a happy drunk). Apparently I’m a half decent writer but I hate everything I’ve ever made- even if people like it I get weirdly angry and depressed and have to leave

That’s nothing thing: even though I put out positivity into the world, I outright despise receiving it. Being celebrated makes me want to disappear forever.

I’m just… done. Even Accomplishing short term goals does nothing for cause of the adhd.

So to hell with it, I hope you all accomplish your dreams! Find your paths! And make the most of it all!

recently he's been posting a bunch of venting videos, which made me think: ""instead of doing these, can't you just come talk to our friend group or something?"" well, that's hard to do when the people you're trying to reach out to won't take you seriously.

(bit of background info: i've been friends with him for a long time and he's been acting pretty rude as of late. found out he also did a really shitty thing to someone outside my friend group so i suppose that also moved my mind in that direction a bit. i'm not trying to justify my thoughts just because of that though.)

i got tired of seeing his posts because of the fact that nothing was changing despite the comment section being filled with supportive people, so i decided to dm him myself about it and ask what's been bothering him lately. i've been someone who was able to truly listen to his issues a couple of times in the past, so i thought he'd be able to talk to me this time without me needing to reach out first.

today i found out i'm the only one in our group who's tried talking to him first about his recent issues.

before talking to him, i kept making assumptions that he was just looking for pity points online and i was about to tell him to get his shit together. turns out that was the last thing he needed, but luckily i decided to reach out to him first before saying anything.

i'm glad that i never said that.

because he was planning to take his life tomorrow.

after talking to him i think he's okay now, or at least i hope so. i let him know that i'm always available if he ever needed to vent out his feelings and he thanked me for it. i didn't want to call the authorities because i don't want to unintentionally put him in a psych ward or something like that. it's also late, so i don't know if my parents would appreciate that.

i just feel so fucking terrible because i was ranting about the situation earlier and how so many people were willing to listen if he needed it, but it just seemed like he was blatantly ignoring the offers (even though that was NOT the case.) i should've learned about what was going on with him on the inside before guessing anything.

if i just made one wrong decision to be aggressive about how he felt, i could've lost him. i can't let go of that and i don't think i will be anytime soon.

Everything is just so..boring, i feel fine, i do get interested in things and i feel happy/normal/balanced i just, im so fucking bored lately
usually school keeps me like not bored, and i do feel like engaged in things and happy around my friends at school, im 16yo and in my country it's the last year of like ""primary school"", i have two months before im leaving this place i went to at 6yo, incredibly freeing but scary too 
everyone's been kind of closer lately, parties etc, honestly its because there's the knowledge that we'll probably all never see eachother much/ever again
but im happy, i have friends, and i just feel generally okay, but i dont really have friends outside of school unless i go drink with my school friends

im so terrified but excited about switching schools, at first im pretty shy, weird and bad at first interactions, but people might come up to me etc
and the school is kind of known as this ""party school"", so i have plenty of opportunities to meet people when ive had a few and im not so fucking weird 😭
anyway, so you have to apply to the new school/high school and you apply with your gpa and the gpa of the school i want to go has always been way below my gpa but there's so many people applying there and im so incredibly stressed, although lately ive been quite relaxed bc there's been a couple weeks without any tests/etc, but this week ""test season"" starts and i have around 20 or so tests before the middle of may, and other graded assignments aren't even counted in this, i know i dont have it hard and honestly i have it really easy but everyone is so stressed, ive seen multiple people literally break down after tests so the mood is very well...yeah, stressed 😭

and trust me, i know how it is to feel depressed, i had a really bad depressive episode from around 12yo-14yo and i was a completely different person, i couldn't bare to be in day to day life, i was completely isolated from everyone  and couldn't find any joy or satisfaction, importance or interest to really anything because i was so fucking sad, tired and either feeling too much or nothing at all, the sadness was this aching, painful kind of sad where I'd just cry all the time and i was really really really self destructive and had a lot of thoughts im very happy i didn't listen to, im very happy im here still

It just feels so overwhelming. I need to feel pain to level it out. I literally feel like the world is ending and crumbling and there is no hope and that I’m doomed. It’s horrible. 

I can feel when it’s about to come on, I just have to prepare I guess. Idk.

- Lost my grandmother
- Found out my mom’s cancer returned for the fourth time
- Fiancé cheated and ended our relationship just four months before our wedding
- Lost my grandfather
- Got laid off from my job after only eight months
- Moved back in with my parents and relocated permanently to a new state
- My mom has been hospitalized three separate times
- As of today, we’ve learned that my mom’s cancer treatment has stopped working, and she likely doesn’t have much time left (no exact timeline given yet)

Each event has compounded my trauma, leaving me little space or time to recover emotionally. The breakup caused the loss of most of my friendships, and the physical distance makes it hard to lean on my siblings for support. Losing my job has stripped away my independence and forced me back into relying on family at a time when I desperately want to be a source of strength, rather than a burden.

I’ve consistently applied for new jobs, putting effort into rebuilding my life, but nothing has materialized yet. Due to my mom’s condition and our new location, I haven’t had the emotional or mental capacity to build new friendships.

I have a sister that is significantly older than me, I am in my early 20s and she is over a decade older and we’ve both exhibited mental health issues our entire lives (like majority of our family). However recently, as she’s gotten married and has talked about having children soon, I’ve noticed some of her habits have become worse and worse and I am honestly really afraid for my future nieces/ nephews. I know this might sound horrible, but I was just wondering if someone else has ever been in this position?

For background information, I love her of course. And I would never do anything to sabotage her having children, or even say anything. But I’m so afraid of watching everything play out like it always has since I was a kid. 

My sister hasn’t really been diagnosed with anything that we know of, but she’s had violent outbursts ever since we were children. And I was just informed that these outbursts have followed into her adulthood. She also has never admitted any wrong doing, like ever, for anything in her entire life. Even if she said the sky was green today, you’d have to agree with her or she’d throw a fit and belittle you. Her emotions are never consistent, one day she’ll throw a fit over something you’d do, the next day you’ll do the same thing and she’ll copy you and love it. I could never get through to her even for something little. Her inconsistency and outbursts really worry me and I don’t want the cycle of a broken families to continue honestly, and I don’t want any of it to weight on me. I know it’s really not my place, but I can’t help but worry. My mom says she might get better when she has the kids, but that seems like a recipe for disaster imo. Does anyone know how to cope?

I’m running out of people to talk to during my triggering moments. My family hasn’t ever been very good with emotional stuff so that’s already off the table. My friends don’t really understand the pain I’m going through so I don’t feel comfortable venting to them. I feel like my bf is getting tired of me venting so I don’t wanna burden him with any more of my struggles. I’ve been venting on reddit a lot lately, at least until I got kicked out from one of my favourite subreddits for lashing out at people for invalidating my pain. I’ve gotten the impression that most people here don’t really know how to treat sensitive topics in a tactful manner, so I just don’t feel safe enough to talk about them here anymore.  

I also used to try out therapy for a couple of years, but never felt understood enough with them. Many of my past therapists were quite neglectful towards my struggles actually, which has made me repulsed of the idea of trying therapy again. My last therapist validated these feelings towards my previous therapists, since the therapy methods in my country are not designed for neurodivergent brains. Unfortunately she was unable to help me either, but at least she confirmed it’s not my fault and I’m just an unusual case for most therapists.  
I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do in times like these when my brain has too much pain. I feel like I’m running out of places to talk about these things. In fact, I feel like I’m running out of things to talk about, since I just keep repeating the same things over and over and only hear the same solutions, which I’ve tested out thoroughly already. There’s no point in talking about any of it anymore. I’m unfixable and noone knows how to show support either, not even mental health professionals. I feel so alone.

reddit,1jq7cu4,mentalhealth,2025-04-03 08:17:18,My brother is dating my old bully :/,"So my brother (21) has started dating this girl (18) who went to the same secondary school as me. Her entire friend group would bully me the entire time I was there, nothing physical other than like drawing on my books or putting water on my bag. She was never one of the main ones who said/did anything but she happily stood and laughed at my expense. 

This really affected me at the time. I was depressed in secondary school and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder so they put me in support groups but that gave the group of girls more things to pick on. And honestly seeing/talking to any of these girls now brings me right back to that place mentally. 

She’s been nice to me since they got together but we went to the same college and she was not particularly the nicest to me then either so I know she’s only being polite to make my brother happy. 
She likes to claim to my mum and my brother that she looked out for me in secondary school because our brothers were best mates so she knew who I was. That’s a straight up lie. I’ve told my mum about all of this + she remembers from when it was happening but I don’t really want to rock the boat by calling my brothers gf out on all of this. 

Honestly what makes this worse is I’m currently going through a lot mentally rn without this on top. When I see her or hear her speak I go right back into that anxious state I was in back then. And she’s here almost every day since she lives pretty close (5 mins walk ish) 

I don’t know what to do. It’s taking such a toll on me mentally. It’s already hard for me to leave my room without her in the house but when she’s here it’s an impossible task. But my brother is so happy with her and they do seem to be good for each other. Maybe i need to get over it and hope that she’s changed but I just cant fully believe that she has.

Then I sat down and suddenly, I started breathing very fast, I couldn't stop.
Then, I got numbness and tingling in my face, hands, and stomach muscles.
My body wouldn't stop jerking, and muscles kept tensioning without my command.
I was still breathing very fast and closed my eyes.
I couldn't think of anything, and I was overwhelmed by everything that was going on.
I dont know how long this went on for, but it felt like 10 minutes. 
I didn't have any pain anywhere, but a lot of tingling and numbness.
I couldn't even control my hands to pick up my phone.
After some time, I started to calm down, and I still have some numbness in my lower back, directly on my spinal chord, which is fixing itself.

I dont think it was a panic attack.
Wouldn't a panic attack happen out of nowhere and cause chest pain?

reddit,1jq6tfn,mentalhealth,2025-04-03 07:50:37,I am terrified,"Hi, I am turning to reddit because I fear I can't trust anyone in my family or around me. I am having extreme anxiety and lots of different issues going on which have been only getting worse. My mom wants me to get a job but I'm terrified of people and think they all want to hurt me, I am terrified of getting sick and I feel like I'm always being watched so I'm almost always tense. 

Stuff goes on in my mind that I can't even put into words. I don't really believe I'm human. And I'm scared of the doctors and the medicine they have prescribed I fear all it's going to do is make me worse. Sometimes I think their ultimate goal is to drive me to s*icide. I'm so scared of getting sick I scrub my hands until they crack up and bleed.

My mom is threatening to hit me because I been leaving some splatters of water on the floor. I know I'm disappointing everyone around me. She never has hit me but I just wish she would understand. Maybe she wants me to get sick? I don't know but I'm really not okay and I want to move out so bad but I can barely even think straight I have horrible brain fog and dissociation. I'm scared to leave the house alone. 

They are making me take the pills and I don't necessarily want to take them because this anxiety keeps me safe and I don't want the pills to cause side effects and make me worse. Besides I don't believe I'm human and I don't have mental disorders I'm just trying to protect myself from things I would have never experienced if I wasn't put here. I am back and forth on this belief but right now I truly believe it. 

What should I do? I'm terrified, I have no goal in life, I barely enjoy anything, I can't think half the time, I'm on autopilot, I'm bullied online,  I don't believe I can function as an adult but everyone is pushing me to and I'm reaching my breaking point. I don't feel safe anywhere in this world. But I'm to scared to die because I'm scared of hell. To scared to live and to scared to die so I'm frozen in place. 

This all is stuff I'm to scared to share but it goes on in my mind daily. I don't want people to think I'm even more crazy and I definitely don't want to be hospitalised. Speaking of hospitalised they are talking sending me and my mom might be calling the doctor and telling them I'm not taking my pill. 

I don't know I guess my ultimate goal here is to get my own little apartment somewhere and get an online job then never leave. No germs, I wouldn't bother my family anymore, and I wouldn't need to take pills. I'm just scared I will need a clear mind and to be able to concentrate in order to do a job. I hate this brain fog. 

(TW self harm) I cope sometimes by cutting and they said the next time I do that I will be hospitalised. They get very angry and think I'm doing all this to hurt them when I'm not. I been doing it again and I really don't want anyone to find out this time. I just wish someone could understand.

Sorry for such a long ass post but I really needed someone to hear this. Most of this I've never shared and I'm sure a lot of it is all in my head.

It’s absolute ass. I’m 26 with no job, literally no friends, not close with family because most of them are toxic and triggering to be around, I have no hobbies because I given up on them because I have ADHD and can’t keep a hobby for shit, dealing with 4 different mental health conditions, and living in a space where I can’t fully escape my toxic family. I try so hard to be positive everyday especially because I believe in manifestation but I also believe in not pretending and lying to yourself about how you feel and I’m so tired of lying about how I feel. I tried so many different therapist none of them do anything for me, making friends as an adult is hard because when you try to join groups they are all older people which is fine but I can’t really fully relate yet, and overall I just engage in bad habits like scrolling social media and eating junk food because I feel like it’s the only thing that brings me happiness. It’s hard to keep going because I hated my life since I was born because I’ve dealt with some heavy stuff with my family and not knowing what it’s like to have healthy genuine people in your circle.

reddit,1jq6kk0,mentalhealth,2025-04-03 07:38:26,"I Feel Trapped, and My Family Won't Understand","I (F22) was clinically diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in 2023 after an assessment at a psych center near my home. Therapy was recommended, with medication as a backup if therapy didn’t help. At the time, I wanted to manage things on my own—journaling, watching TEDx talks, and diving into self-help videos. Surprisingly, what helped me the most was moving out to a different city for almost a year to finish my studies.

But when I moved back home, everything I had managed to keep under control started unraveling again. It feels like my family is suffocating me. The abuse, the disrespect, the violence, the narcissism, and the closed-mindedness—I just can’t take it. And then, just a few months later, we moved to a different country to live with my grandmother, who has been a major source of my mental distress since childhood. Her words and actions have tormented me for years, and now I have to live under the same roof as her again.

I recently overheard my family talking about taking me somewhere for a consultation, but I’m terrified. I don’t think they understand what I actually need, and I’m afraid to tell them that the real problem is being around them.

I also suspect I might have PMDD, but I don’t have the resources to get checked right now. The last time I brought it up with an OB-Gyne, they dismissed me completely.

reddit,1jq5v7d,mentalhealth,2025-04-03 07:04:53,I'm having a really bad time,"Hey, if I make any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes I'm sorry I'm both dyslexic and struggling so didn't proof read.

 so I'm am a 15 year old girl who has recently (as of July 2024) been diagnosed with both autism and adhd. 

As a bit of context I have had 4 major people in my life die in the span of 4 year one of which being my dad who was an achoholic when I was 7 leading to me forming a codependency with my mum out of fear of abandonment, this has also lead to some amount of anxiety and low mood for pretty much as long as I can remember, however i have been to both counselling and therapy which helped greatly. The past 8-9 months I have been going through what my mental health nurse has speculated was autistic burnout which has morphed into a depression.

 I have always been an achiever, the top of not only my class but also my entire school as well as doing many extra curriculars all of which I greatly enjoyed and placed as my sole value however  i couldn't handle the pressure of all that and the self imposed desire to be ""normal"" and forcing myself to be normal.

 Slowly but surely I have begun a self isolation and don't talk to my friends, don't see my boyfriend, don't go to school, and I have no energy to study. This has impacted me greatly because my academic achievements are all i say i have and to lose that has certainly added to my depression. 

I have to very close cousins who have autism, and it has been especially hard to come to terms with my diagnosis due to that fact, all my life I have been told to give them allowances I was never afforded adding to the pressure to excel and the eventual meltdown I had in July. I am struggling with the fact that my brain and body are at war, I have exams in less than a month and yet I am incapable of doing anything but worry over it because all I do is sit and rot in my bed. I feel like I am already dead, and I kinda want to be. Every night I go to sleep wishing I'd never wake up and every morning i am disappointed when i do. 

The only true support I feel I have is my mum and my therapist (It's through CAMHS so it's not great). My family doesn't believe in mental health with children which is almost worse than not believing in it at all, they think in to young to have anything like that. 

My mum keeps getting mad at me when she says im acting better, I feel as though I'm getting worse just better at hiding it from her. she also says that I'm not trying to get better, and the thing is I'm not even sure she's wrong, I'm so exhausted yet my mind go wild and I can't see anyway out because getting better relie on me but right now I can't relie on me. I can't see a way out of this, I feel I've dug myself into a hole to deep that ill never get back from.

I’m (20M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been together for over a year now and have been happy together for that year. She is super amazing and cheerful to be around but has had a bit of a troubled life. She’s lost two uncles before the age of 18, has had other family members be “not visited” for years on end and some are (were) addicts. She does not seem to be traumatized by it. She’s the oldest of 5 and has a special needs brother. Her parents don’t have “favorites” but her father clearly shows more admiration and pride for the eldest son. For years she has had panic attacks and really bad anxiety to where it brings her to tears oftentimes. The thing is, her father is a bit, to put it lightly not the most on board with modern medicine and therapeutic practices and has a huge problem with the pharmaceutical industry. He’s not at all a bad guy he genuinely means well for his children and wants the best for them. Her mother does try her best to do what she can but is not able to do much against her father. He only let her go to therapy after she was doing self-____ and didn’t even let her finish therapy before pulling her out claiming it to be a bunch of bs designed to make you think something is wrong with you so companies can sell their products. He believes that meditation and exercise is what she needs but it just doesn’t work for her. He forbids prescription medicine for his children (she’s the oldest at 19 and the youngest is 8 months) because it’s how his brother and his half-brother passed away (OD). She’s undiagnosed (as far as I’m aware of) with panic attacks and GAD. Just lately it has been getting worse and I cannot change this man’s mind and I don’t want to be sneaky and take her to see a therapist behind his back. All I want is the best for her and having her cry almost every night on the phone hurts me a lot and I feel powerless. So I ask the people of Reddit for any guidance.

Idk I am afraid that it won't ever go away I do better for a little bit and better is just surviving. Then I will kind of fall back into feeling awful and recently I've been feeling this same unmotivated deep sadness or apathy. 

I tried taking medication again but it literally just made me a lot worse and undid any progress I felt like I had made actually. I had a pretty scary moment where I woke up with severe neck pain after taking lexapro it was the first dose and I felt sick to my stomach. I fell back asleep but the next day my neck was so sore I couldn't even move it around. I was like that for two weeks it is just now coming back to normal. I stopped taking it immediately because that was so terrifying I have never had anything like that happen to me before.  I feel like if I brought this up with anyone they would think I'm being paranoid but it was so painful I wanted to cry and I felt so terribly physically and mentally right after and in the weeks following.

  
I just want to know like what helps. Does anyone else suffer from depression and meds just do not help? They always just seem to make me feel way worse and swing me into a depressive state.

reddit,1jq4kv1,mentalhealth,2025-04-03 06:03:20,Depressed due to unsatisfied sexual experience with wife.,"Hi all, good day,

I’m 36 and have been married for 7 years. During my 20s-30s, I was sexually active with ex-partners and never experienced erection/climax issues. Before marriage, I didn’t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife.



In contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners/prostitutes before marriage, which heightened my sexual expectations. My wife was hesitant and timid about sex, which made intimacy challenging. During this time + currently, I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography (averaging twice daily), which has since escalated to rough contents (scat, spy etc...).



Over time, my wife and I developed better communication about sex, including watching porn together and discussing kinks. She is a wonderful partner, and we now want to start a family. However, I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused. She knows this. We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh.



I also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her, though she says she enjoys our intimacy. I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance. We use sex toys, lubes etc, but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others.

I’m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges.",Depressed due to unsatisfied sexual experience with wife Hi all good day I m 36 and have been married for 7 years During my 20s 30s I was sexually active with ex partners and never experienced erection climax issues Before marriage I didn t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife In contrast I had been involved with more experienced partners prostitutes before marriage which heightened my sexual expectations My wife was hesitant and timid about sex which made intimacy challenging During this time currently I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography averaging twice daily which has since escalated to rough contents scat spy etc Over time my wife and I developed better communication about sex including watching porn together and discussing kinks She is a wonderful partner and we now want to start a family However I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused She knows this We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh I also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her though she says she enjoys our intimacy I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance We use sex toys lubes etc but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others I m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges,1,2,"contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners",Initial-Parsley-8005,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jq4kv1/depressed_due_to_unsatisfied_sexual_experience/,0.908,0.21766666666666662,Low,Positive

All my life, I’ve had random bouts of sadness that never go away, along with self-hatred and generally low self-esteem, sometimes accompanied by suicidal thoughts. I don’t want to assume that I have anything since I haven’t been diagnosed. But this month has been the absolute worst for me, and it all started from one trigger.



For a little bit of context, I’m a freshman BS Psychology student at National University, and I made the terrible decision to cheat on one of my major subjects—Psychological Statistics. I’ve been an honor student my whole life, and my parents, especially my mother, always compare me to others who do well. That pressure haunts my every action, forcing me to strive for the best, even when it’s destroying me inside.



I cheated—not on the entire test, but on about 10 out of 100 items—because I have an extremely bad habit of overthinking. I accepted the fact that I got caught, took a zero on my finals, and took full responsibility for what I did. I understand that it was wrong. But the most painful part of this whole situation isn’t that I didn’t make it to the Dean’s List—since I barely passed Psych Stats (I got a 1.5, while my other grades were around 3.5 or 4). It’s the fact that my teacher vouched for me. She knew I was a diligent student, that I obviously tried, and that I was a model student in class who just made a bad decision. Because of her, along with the department head, I was only given a zero in the finals rather than being reported for a major academic dishonesty offense. I am very grateful to them.



But what hurts the most is how I got caught. Apparently, someone in my class had told my teacher about it since midterms. I had been cheating that way since midterms, and that’s how I was exposed. The fact that my own classmates did this to me has crushed me. Now, I feel like I don’t deserve anything I’ve ever achieved. I’ve started isolating myself from my friends because I keep thinking—why would they even want to associate with someone as pathetic as me? I can’t even trust my own circle of friends because they had already heard the rumors about my cheating since midterms, but they never told me.



Every time I’m in class, I feel like when they look at me, it’s with disgust, and I just want to cry and disappear. I don’t even know why I stayed in this section. I should’ve just registered in another one, but now, I just go along with my friend group, pretending nothing’s wrong.



I feel so worthless every day because I feel like a burden to everyone. And honestly, it’s true—no one gains anything from me. I’m just some pathetic kid who’s too greedy for achievements.



I feel like I’m going insane. I’ve become so paranoid in class that I don’t even want to participate in recitations anymore because I feel like no one likes me. I’ve always been fragile when it comes to how others perceive me.



I’ve actually been like this since high school, but I managed to develop a bit of self-care in senior high. Then a breakup happened with my ex, and now this happened in my second term of freshman year. And honestly? I just want to die and end it all. I’m such a lazy, useless person. My mom was right—I really am worthless. Haha. Even here, I couldn’t bring myself to post this on my main account because I’m too much of a coward, afraid that my friends and family might find out.

I didn't enjoy being around people, bc I have low self esteem and I fried my brain with videogames, and now videogames are boring and I have no one.

Virgin at 23, because I am also a porn addict and excessive beater, so I am no longer attracted to girls and now I have 0 libido.

I replaced people with instant gratification.

I have been working for a very competitive exam to better my future for the last 18 months (my second try for this exam) while being socially isolated, I don't do anything else. Even if I win this exam, it won't pay too good. Also no interest in this job field, doing this only to survive.

Result of this exam and my personality, I stay at home and never go out or talk and meet with new people.

I no longer have the courage to meet new people

I always run out of things when I talk to people, so this weird awkward silence occurs every time, so no friendships and no relationships

I was bullied in every part of my school life because I have been too kind and silent, so I am distant to people

Too late to build friendships and no desire to build one

I have this belief that even if I was in a relationship, I wouldn't be happy and we would fight with each other and end up in a heartbreak, so I don't even try to find love, I don't want to ruin my life or someone else's

I have been suffering from low self esteem my whole life

Getting up, going to work feels like a death sentence, because I know that it won't pay enough and I will live paycheck to paycheck

Low pay, long working hours, and one of the highest inflation in the world (Turkiye).

Nothing exciting is waiting for me in the future. I will eventually get old and die. I won't be having children because I don't like the world.

Azan is played 5 times or more everyday from a very loud speaker, I am an atheist and I hate Islam, so it's bothering and stressing me.

Politicians are ruining everything, corruption is very prevalent

No hope for the future, I also hate my ethnicity; people are rude, loud, boastful, and stupid. One of the reasons I chose to stay alone, there were also nice people but most of them were like these.

My hair is shedding from stress, anxiety and depression. I also won't like the way it will look once I go bald

I wake up at night randomly with heart palpations

I overthink and overanalyze, so I always think about what to say next when having conversations, while other people talk with each other like a breath

I have lived the most boring life; no crazy adventures, no partying, no drinking, no getting laid. Because I spent all my time playing games and worrying about my future.

I've been already had a bad week, this monday I had an argument with a best friend of mine, I hurt him very deeply and I can't forgive myself over it. and my mother and sister had a fight and are mad at each other, this thursday i completely lost my mind too, and immediately isolated from everyone, my friends, close all of my contacts online as soon as I came back to home.

This wednesday, my parents left for the entire day, and I was okay. I was having mood swings, as per usual, swinging between ""I don't need anyone"" to ""I need my friends"" to ""I am a horrible person"", and I was absolutely angry for no reason, I started to have thoughts about me putting loud music just for the sake of it, to let everyone know how mad I was.

I felt a bit overpowered, by just doing that, and I started to feel impulsive, I grabbed some scissors and cut a bit of my hair, it didn't felt enough, i wanted to change my entire persona, my entire life, my entire identity or appearance, so I got mad. Then I went back to the living room, and I was like, ""Hey, no one is home, no one can stop me from drinking?""

I grabbed some alcohol, and started drinking it with mixed juice, it was fine, until the juice ran out, and then I desperately needed to drink more for some odd reason, so I drank pure alcohol. I started to feel dizzy, moving with difficulty, struggling to walk and moving a lot. 

I did something bad, I felt the urge to hurt myself, I wanted to experience how it feels to cut myself, to self harm myself, I felt like i needed to feel something, i had to feel enough, I don't know why, but I felt like I needed to do it. I desperately grabbed a knife, but it wasn't sharp enough, so I went over a sharpener there was in my backpack, and I threw it into the floor violently to break it and get the blade.

Then, I started thinking, so I just decided to cut somewhere no one would notice, my thighs/hip, I started cutting a bit, no blood, fortunately, but it did hurt, but it didn't feel enough. I went back to the living room, struggling to walk, and I grabbed alcohol, and started drinking again, directly by the bottle. 

I kept falling on the floor, struggling and stumbling into everything, I was dizzy, and I kept going back to my room, grabbing the blade again and cutting myself more in the thigh. then back into the living room and drinking. 

I started to get worse, at some point after 15 minutes of doing the same thing over and over again, I started talking to myself, repeating ""i'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" and ""I'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay. nothing is wrong, i'm being dramatic, i'm exaggerating"", ""Please somebody help me"" as I kept walking and stumbling into everything, to the point i fell into the ground of my living room alone, started screaming and crying, kicking my feet into the air and the ground, as the music played loud enough to no one heard me, and I couldn't get up anymore.

I started to crawl into the floor, i felt decided to commit suicide, I had saved some medicine in my drawers that I've been stealing off the bathroom without anyone noticing, in case I wanted to commit desperately, and it was a good timing, I was drunk, crying, messy and losing control in the floor as I crawled, cried and repeated myself over and over again. ""I'm sorry"", ""I just wanted to be happy"", ""I didn't meant things to end like this"" and crying, regretting how a single fun thing ended in something like this because I couldn't control myself.

I felt miserable and stupid, as I crawled, near to the drawer in the ground, until I threw up. I threw up in the floor of my bedroom, I couldn't see at all, I just kept throwing up and started to roll in the ground, dizzy and disgusted, my face covered in vomit as I kept seeing the red vomit (from the alcohol) in the floor, and I wanted to keep going to the drawer, but all of it was around the floor where I had to go, so I gave up, and I tried standing up again, almost impossible to stand up, with my last strengths, I fell again on the floor, and I crawled in the living room again.

  
I couldn't anymore, I couldn't commit, so I was scared, this is a brand new experience to me, I kept seeing my scars in my thigh and realized how there was no turning back, so I crawled to the table and grabbed my phone. I sent my brother a message ""Please help, please."" And then fell on my parents bed. 

I had the apartment door locked because I left my keys placed on it, so it couldn't be opened from outside, it was like I had it all planned to die in the moment. I heard my brother hit the door with his hand and calling me, and with my strength I stood up and I walked to the door, stumbling and impossibly walking correctly, and I took the keys out, so he could use his.

He entered, saw me crying and shaking, my head constantly moving, and immediately assisted me.

He made me sit, immediately noticed what was going on, I told him I lost my mind, something on me exploded and wanted to do everything I never wanted to, cut myself, drink like crazy and then attempt. He comforted me, called my mother, and my parents came desperately from being away from home.

I'm okay now, they all assisted me, helped me, it was a horrible moment. I don't know if I'll ever drink alcohol again, this was horrific to me, it felt close enough to death to me. The scars are still in my thigh, now I'm not afraid anymore of harming myself, it almost feels like they're not enough and that I have to make more.

But, I'm okay now, I'm safe, everything is good. i'm here.

mad I was I felt a bit overpowered by just doing that and I started to feel impulsive I grabbed some scissors and cut a bit of my hair it didn t felt enough i wanted to change my entire persona my entire life my entire identity or appearance so I got mad Then I went back to the living room and I was like Hey no one is home no one can stop me from drinking I grabbed some alcohol and started drinking it with mixed juice it was fine until the juice ran out and then I desperately needed to drink more for some odd reason so I drank pure alcohol I started to feel dizzy moving with difficulty struggling to walk and moving a lot I did something bad I felt the urge to hurt myself I wanted to experience how it feels to cut myself to self harm myself I felt like i needed to feel something i had to feel enough I don t know why but I felt like I needed to do it I desperately grabbed a knife but it wasn t sharp enough so I went over a sharpener there was in my backpack and I threw it into the floor violently to break it and get the blade Then I started thinking so I just decided to cut somewhere no one would notice my thighs hip I started cutting a bit no blood fortunately but it did hurt but it didn t feel enough I went back to the living room struggling to walk and I grabbed alcohol and started drinking again directly by the bottle I kept falling on the floor struggling and stumbling into everything I was dizzy and I kept going back to my room grabbing the blade again and cutting myself more in the thigh then back into the living room and drinking I started to get worse at some point after 15 minutes of doing the same thing over and over again I started talking to myself repeating i m sorry I m sorry I m sorry and I m okay i m okay i m okay nothing is wrong i m being dramatic i m exaggerating Please somebody help me as I kept walking and stumbling into everything to the point i fell into the ground of my living room alone started screaming and crying kicking my feet into the air and the ground as the music played loud enough to no one heard me and I couldn t get up anymore I started to crawl into the floor i felt decided to commit suicide I had saved some medicine in my drawers that I ve been stealing off the bathroom without anyone noticing in case I wanted to commit desperately and it was a good timing I was drunk crying messy and losing control in the floor as I crawled cried and repeated myself over and over again I m sorry I just wanted to be happy I didn t meant things to end like this and crying regretting how a single fun thing ended in something like this because I couldn t control myself I felt miserable and stupid as I crawled near to the drawer in the ground until I threw up I threw up in the floor of my bedroom I couldn t see at all I just kept throwing up and started to roll in the ground dizzy and disgusted my face covered in vomit as I kept seeing the red vomit from the alcohol in the floor and I wanted to keep going to the drawer but all of it was around the floor where I had to go so I gave up and I tried standing up again almost impossible to stand up with my last strengths I fell again on the floor and I crawled in the living room again I couldn t anymore I couldn t commit so I was scared this is a brand new experience to me I kept seeing my scars in my thigh and realized how there was no turning back so I crawled to the table and grabbed my phone I sent my brother a message Please help please And then fell on my parents bed I had the apartment door locked because I left my keys placed on it so it couldn t be opened from outside it was like I had it all planned to die in the moment I heard my brother hit the door with his hand and calling me and with my strength I stood up and I walked to the door stumbling and impossibly walking correctly and I took the keys out so he could use his He entered saw me crying and shaking my head constantly moving and immediately assisted me He made me sit immediately noticed what was going on I told him I lost my mind something on me exploded and wanted to do everything I never wanted to cut myself drink like crazy and then attempt He comforted me called my mother and my parents came desperately from being away from home I m okay now they all assisted me helped me it was a horrible moment I don t know if I ll ever drink alcohol again this was horrific to me it felt close enough to death to me The scars are still in my thigh now I m not afraid anymore of harming myself it almost feels like they re not enough and that I have to make more But I m okay now I m safe everything is good i m here Thanks,2,1,"my backpack, and I threw it into the floor violently to break it and get the

If people who killed themselves due to depression were instead said to have been 'killed by depression' or 'died due to depression', in the same way people 'die from cancer', would mental health be taken more seriously?  Would there be changes?

If it was reframed to put the responsibility for death on the illness itself, and *not on the person who didn't get help in time*, or on the doctors who didn't do everything they could to help the sick person, would that help in some way?  After all, for many people depression is a terminal illness in the same way that cancer is, so why not treat it the same way?

reddit,1jq7pes,suicidewatch,2025-04-03 08:34:52,I am a Failure. By every definition of it.,"For the last three years, I’ve been stuck in a cycle of procrastination, avoidance, and self-doubt. I kept telling myself I would change, that I would get serious, that I had time. But I didn’t. Time ran out. I failed a major exam—one I can’t retake. No second chances, no redemption, just failure staring me in the face.

Right now, I feel like I’ve thrown away years of my life. I had ambitions, big ones. I wanted to be disciplined, to push myself, to win. But instead, I let fear control me. I avoided the hard work. I wasted days, weeks, months, thinking “I’ll do it tomorrow.” Now there’s no tomorrow for this exam. Just the realization that I didn’t fight hard enough.

The worst part? I didn’t even give it my all. I didn’t fail because I tried my hardest and fell short—I failed because I was a coward. I let laziness, fear, and distraction dictate my actions. I ignored reality until it was too late. And now, I’m left with regret.

And honestly? It’s eating me alive. I’ve had suicidal thoughts because of this. I feel like I don’t deserve to keep going after wasting so much time. But at the same time, there’s still a small part of me that wants to fight, that wants to fix this and never let it happen again.

For those of you who’ve been in a place like this—where you’ve wasted years and had to rebuild from rock bottom—how did you do it? How do you go from being a lazy, inconsistent mess to someone who actually executes every single day? How do I make sure I never, ever end up here again?

I love this planet, all the creatures and everything in it.

My grandma would mention him occasionally, but I still know next to nothing about him, except that he was making a lot of money near the time of his death. At this point in my life, though I honestly have no other options. My grandma pretty much turned her back on me whenever I asked her for help. She could only help with $400 which I was grateful for, but it’s not enough to hold me over during this difficult situation in my life right now I feel like all of my resources are pretty much expended most of my family that I could reach out for pretty much put me under the same connotation as my mother and sum me up as a type of person that’s pretty much identical to her. Even though my family knows the gist of what I’ve been through and the type of person that I am. They still have a lot of animosity for me that I don’t understand my guess is a lot of them are homophobic or something else but nonetheless, they don’t really have in their hearts to help me so my mother really asked me out of all of my opportunities. I know that I have a lot of opportunities but my situation right now is really lethal. I thank God for everything that he’s blessed me with and all the opportunities that I came into this life with, but I can’t do this anymore. all I know is that I don’t deserve to live like this or to have experience the things that I’ve experienced. I believe I have the divine right to stop my suffering. Some of the people on this planet are completely demonic.

I am super glad to have this feeling of maybe being free for good? On the 10th day, after semi-developed addiction (but still an addiction), I have caught myself for the past 3-4 days, that I feel actually \*better\* than on coke or on alcohol: in the intensity and the duration of my state. I.e., this renders coke, alcohol, cigs useless, then? 

I am super glad, and I think the universe sort of aligns with this feeling by having only the sunny days for these same days.

I mean, for me the hardest was the 3-4-5 days, I think, when I felt this loss of control over the addiction: i.e., I want to get drunk now, and I start having this pleasant anticipation of a pleasure, so I was almost to go for it. However, I had to lie, to reflect, to cry out, to pray, that this was rather tragic, actually: am I not the one in control? Am I to be forever under this demon and fight these urges forever? I cried and cried. So, I even woke up during the night, feeling ""fuck, I need a rest from this urging me all the time during the day"", like some sort of entity tried to manipulate me into promising to give it a rest. THen during the day, I had anger about work's colleauges (who were ""stupid fuckers"") and sadness (""because my wife left, not only cuz of addiction, but of this also, but it's difficult and I am not SO much concerned, but still kind of am, especially when we were doing alco, drugs together""). So, then I just had this ""fuck, I want it"".

And, maybe that's the core part: I was doing psychotherapy with a very good coach/psychologist/spiritual guide, who had me meditate on the feeling of an urge (a day before the above urge). So, I found out that the urge simply disappeared once I have accepted myself? Like, the desire for drunkenness (from anything, really) is just a response to avoiding the pain of not accepting myself. No matter the reason why, but it was quite bizzarre.

And then, after a few days, of walking, without drinking, I was also getting emotional that I was basically anesthizing myself (funnily enough, coke also is like dental anaesthetic, so I found this sort of symbolic), and thus avoiding life, and not actually living and experiencing it? The joy that is much greater? I even got into this surreal, psychedelic like state (w/o drugs) that ok, I actually experienced a \*different\* perception, that is sober, but still different and interesting, as it's not the same old ""get drunk"".

And as a result, I was just feeling like these goose bumps for 1-2 hours, which I have at max for 5 mins on coke. Also, by focusing my thoughts in the direction of ""I resolved this shit, so what much else can I resolve?"", I intensified this sort of euphoric state of achievement.

Moreover, without alcohol and drugs, I had my orgasms much stronger, like it's a sort of energy flowing through me, and also without the porn.

And ok, fair enough, I am still eating chips, but - it's maybe only temporary crutch, and still much better. I ate them anyway with the drugs.

So, in the end, the main question: ""what would them drugs gimme anyway?"" is to be answered by ""a temporary, though guaranteed switch in the state that is worse than I could have organized myself with the consequent depression and further cravings in the future, resulting in the loss of control"". I think, this is a checkmate idea.

And ok, I may sound arrogant here, and I also recognize that saying ""I solved this"" and then bam, a relapse or something, but even then I had preparations that even if the case, even then, I would \*know\* that it's 10 days I didn't do this. And so, like a strategist, I am setting up all these ideas, all these self-reinforcements in all the ways that could potentially have me dragged into the useless shit, based primarily only on this minor subconscious demon that maybe doesn't even want to be inside me.

For instance, I resolved the urges like that: since, I have all these stupid ideas, like ""why don't I grab the wheel of a taxi driver and drive us into the pithole to die or cripple ourselves?"", of which at first I was sort of ashamed, like am I crazy? But then I understood that some have these, and I don't act on it, and so why bother? Then the urges are of the same class: they are not something special, but rather also just stupid ideas that have no basis, on which I can decide not to act. Easy. 

Also, since I finally had the subjective reinforcing experience of feeling good without drugs (well, ok, I still drank coffee, but it's not comparable): then the urges are also easily resolved by referring to the experience of sitting in the sauna on the countdown, on running 10km marathon, on going through the gym sets, or sitting for 6h on a tattoo session, about 10 sessions within 2 weeks and accepting the pain, sort of. All these also cover the flanks, sort to say, like the military units.

And so, in the end, I just wanted to share the experience, and I am still getting used to the good, as my coach told me, when I shared the experiences of feeling unusually well without shit, and being interested and engaged.

In the end, all the hormones: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, noradrenalin, adrenalin, etc. - they are all within me. So, this means that I am the one who can trigger these states, and it's sort of stupid to lose the ability to an external substance. This is the core of not wanting an addiction -> it's like selling a soul to the devil for him to give you your desire, when in fact, your soul IS the thing that can grant you that desire and infinite number of other desires. Selling a debit card with infinite money for a million dollars. Same logic everywhere.

Though, of course, it took me WAY long story of going through psychotherapists (maybe, 10 years, in fact) and during this time the addiction raised or subsided. Like dropping cigs, amphetamines, weed, but keeping alco. And fair enough, judging on what I uncovered in psychotherapy: my mother when dying of cancer blamed me for her death when being in this sort of semi-aware state; a divorce, and everything else, which I have just accepted as a part of my history. Again, I decided to convert the suffering into profits: for instance, now, I can rely on the experience of dropping the addiction process in my future projects. By doing it alone, without the use of psychiatry or rehabs, I am not going to win even a billion of dollars, figuratively speaking, I am going to win the whole world of experience for myself. Namely, working AND feeling good about it. Fucking AND having intense orgasms about it. Speaking to people AND not feeling anxious and being super aware of my and their's psychology and maybe using it to help them, create efficient business processes, make money, travel the world, eat great food. Working and studying AND feeling very aware.

Speaking of the latter, as I dropped it all, I started feeling higher awareness. Like, I am smart myself. But if it's all been covered by the brain fog of drunkenness, then hell am I going to be much more quick. Like, I was just smiling for being very aware of the French exercise that I was learning. This state of feeling good makes me feel even better all by itself: like, I just smile at that I smile at the world without any chemical intervention.

So, it's like this for now. Maybe, this could help someone. After all, addiction is a sort of life's challenge. Tackling addiction is a sort of a game: how can you outplay and outmaneuver a subpersonality of yours before it will chase you to a grave. Maybe, addiction can be appreciated for all the challenges that it teaches you to overcome. Doesn't mean that you need to partake in it, but once you have it, then maybe learn from it. I have a nice principle from childhood stories that you should strive to convert foes to friends, as it would mean that the next foes you face would be even more likely to convert to friends, since you have your older foes at your side already, and so it's a snowball rolling.",10 days no alco coke cigarettes the super fast end of addiction With a LOONG preparation for it Dear all I am super glad

reddit,1jq7ewp,addiction,2025-04-03 08:20:13,How to beat fent/ how to help someone on fent get clean and stay clean ?,"25(f) with a 27 (m) I’ve been with my bf now for almost a year. I know it’s not that long but we’ve been together like everyday. In beginning of relationship I’ve noticed signs overly tired, not as in the mood sexually, nodding, dozing and taking awhile in car. Constant fatigue and napped a lot or slept late. He is a smoker weed and cigs so I thought maybe he was rolling up etc just chilling. He would usually come to me a few hours after coming home from work. But I’d have to call him a lot because he’d fall asleep a lot when he got home. On multiple occasions I’ve found foil, burnt foil specifically and he would leave marks on my door I’d see it on his head and hands from touching his face he would be covered in black debris. He always admitted to no problem. I’ve found him nodded out in car with foil straws and substances. Multiple occasions Id get in the car when he’s nodded out and has no idea I’m there and question him and tell him to tell me the truth I won’t judge. I know he needs help but I can’t help him if he doesn’t own up to him having a problem. This has happened maybe 3/4 times I’ve caught him always blames thca. I was dumb and did my research and people do smoke thca on foil so I gave him the benefit of the doubt but researching symptoms lead me to believe it was an opioid. He’s struggled in the past with Xanax and perks and got clean. But he’s beaten every at home drug test. Because of the signs I saw in him I suspected fent. But wasn’t sure. He’s pretty functioning besides the extreme fatigue and nodd. He’s a great partner super nice sweet thoughtful. Recently we fought again because I found him nodded in car. Then I said I can’t be with you because you lie and lie and lie and I don’t deserve that I know I deserve more. But I can’t help but feel like I’m abandoning him because I feel he needs help. A few days go by I was supposed to see him and then I called and he answered crying saying he needs help. His mom caught him with foil and straw and substance. But he claims he flushed it. We had kinda an intervention with some family and me and we agreeded he needed to detox and he needed to tell us the truth. He blamed it on perks and he flushed everything bag and all. Something told me check the pants when I went in his room. And I found bundles or shit tied up in rubbber bands I went to his mom and confronted her and he came in all upset trying to snatch shit from me I blocked the door and took it back she dumped it on the bed and said what is this. I said it’s not perks I’m not dumb and he admitted it to be fent. Knowing that it’s fent, I’m terrified I don’t want him to die on me. I’m scared my anxiety depression and mind is racing all the time I feel like a detective on here trying to find out what shit could be and how he’ll withdrawal. He went cold turkey but he said he’s been weening himself and he didn’t want to but agreed. He didn’t even give it 24 hours and I found him in the bathroom with foil and straw I broke down it breaks my soul. I’m so scared for him I don’t want him to die. All he wants is to ween of fent himself but how will I know how much he takes. I can’t monitor that. I do believe he wants to stop I don’t think he wants to be dependent I do believe that. I think it has him in a chokehold because of the withdrawal symptoms and he’s scared to go through them. He went through them for like 3/4 hours and he said he wanted to die he can’t take it , he can’t do it, and he needs to ween himself off. I also told him it’s a mental thing he needs to talk himself into it that he could do it and he is strong and he’s not gonna die and he will come out stronger.  I know in my heart he doesn’t wanna be this way. I do believe people could change. He has an option to withdrawal and take tramadol (controlled tho ) to try and help symptoms but idk how effective that would be. What am I supposed to do? Stay and support him and hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel? Do people ween off of fent alone and have the will power to not do more ? Is he a compulsive liar and will I ever trust him? He’s broken to many promises and I’ve caught him with stuff to many times. I feel addicted to trying to understand his addiction. I do have codependent tendencies so I feel empathy and sympathy for him and don’t wanna abandon him but I feel like I’m abandoning me. What do I do ? How could I help? Will things get better ?

reddit,1jq1he3,addiction,2025-04-03 03:43:17,Addictive Personality,"I just need to get this off my chest, even if I’m just shouting into the void. It’s 2:31pm where I am and I’m currently drunk and high (weed). For hours I was trying to fight back the thoughts of drinking. This morning after another night of drinking way more than I should’ve and regretting it the next morning I’ve spent the morning grappling with the fact that I can’t ignore I’m falling into addiction with alcohol. I have a family history of alcoholism on both sides, with my father being an alcoholic. My oldest sister is an alcoholic (she’s since recovered). My mom doesn’t really drink, she’s never enjoyed substances (including just prescription medications) because she doesn’t like not feeling like herself and out of control.)But growing up my mom always informed me of the dangers of drinking. I grew up thinking it was wild that people drank and used drugs underage and was judgmental towards those who did it, because I’d think why would you do something that’s documented so heavily to cause addiction and ultimately harm your life? Then I hit the age of 17, moved for like the billionth time in my life and ended up at a high school where drinking and smoking weed and vaping was very common. Not saying it was like everyone who went to that school but it was normalized for sure. I first get hooked on vaping. I hate my nicotine addiction so so bad and despise the person who first offered it to me, and despise myself even more for taking that first hit. Within a few days I was buying my own vapes. Then I don’t know the exact timeline but another friend also offered me a hit of their wax pen, the euphoria I felt was unmatched, I eventually started smoking everyday. There was even a short period of time I smoked at school, tho I quickly stopped that and just smoked after school and at work. I drank for the first time around that time too, tho at the time I didn’t really enjoy the feeling and felt too out of control and just preferred weed. So it wasn’t something that was a problem at the time. Fast forward, as time goes one I’m smoking everyday and basically high all day minus a few hours overall. I love it, I felt like I was free for the first time in my life, it brought me so much joy and I was young and dumb and believed, weed isn’t addictive so I’m good. But I’d always get so defensive when I’d see people online discussing the fact that weed is in fact addictive. I stopped smoking for about two years when I was pregnant and breastfeeding and being sober for that long I’ve realized how crazy it was that I thought that was normal. But while I was breastfeeding while I missed smoking weed, I wasn’t comfortable with smoking again until I was done breastfeeding. So I drink. It starts out with just one drink a night after I’ve finished cleaning up and have a little time to eat dinner and unwind, this is after my child is a few months old so she wasn’t waking up as frequently most days. Some nights I was experiencing what I now understand was postpartum depression, and same with when I was smoking all the time, if I was feeling particularly heavy emotionally, I didn’t drink so despite knowing of alcoholism runs in my family, I thought to myself this is proof the “addiction genes” skipped me. Because deep down I was so scared of it becoming a problem. Months and months of this, it turned into two drinks a night (sneaking the second drink). Then it became drinking as soon as my baby went to bed. And doing chores while drunk. But I still convinced myself it wasn’t a problem. Then it turned into having one drink during the day. Then finishing off the drink in the morning I didn’t finish be night before, having another drink in the afternoon, and having several drinks at night. A couple months of this and I’m grappling with addiction. I don’t want to accept I have a problem, I want to believe that I can stop and only do it socially. Or that when I’m working full time again (I’m currently a SAHM) that it’ll change, bc the days I work, I love my job so much and don’t think about drinking at all, and when I get home, I don’t really feel like drinking (still Ill have one or two tho). I haven’t been needed at work for like a month now (it’s a on call type of job) so my drinking has just gotten worse. I feel like a terrible person and mother. My boyfriend is so kind and gentle with me and expresses his worry, but he doesn’t know that I’ve drink occasionally during the day. When he’s off of work he knows that I like to drink before we go out. I justified it saying I just miss smoking weed, but now that I’ve added weed back into the equation and am in the early stages of smoking again, it feels worse than drinking. So I only do it at night and take like one hit small hit, sometimes two. So instead of smoking weed I’m drinking before going to go grocery shopping or going out to eat (where I make sure we go somewhere that serves alcohol so I can drink more). I’ve been trying to convince myself once I’ve gotten acclimated back into smoking weed I’ll drop the drinking. But it’s not true. I’m addicted. It hasn’t even been a year of my drinking daily and I’m already an alcoholic. I used to think to myself my mom’s concern with me drinking was her cursing me. That I was above what’s written in my DNA. I have a problem that I can’t control. It’s gotten to the point that some days after a night of really heavy drinking I have shakes. So I drink during the day to subside it. Tonight when my boyfriend gets home from work I’m going to admit that yes I do have a problem and I let my ego get in that way of seeing and accepting it. I think my love for substances comes from my struggle with intrusive thoughts. I’m looking for a therapist because I know I need professional help. I want to do better for my family and myself.

I constantly hear my neighbours talking about taking me to court for a restitution for property damage to furniture and the air conditioning system and it’s going to cost upwards of 200,000 and that I will likely get out on mental health grounds because of my bipolar.

They are apparently testing the waste water because our pipes are connected so whenever I urinate or number two they test it and see if the readings gone up or down. 

Apparently I caused someone to have a failed pregnancy because the chemicals somehow went through the air conditioning system which is supposedly connected centrally for everyone in the apartment system and I also broke the aircon somehow as well which will be in the court case.

They are testing samples on my rubbish like drink bottles etc and are following and tracking me everywhere and commenting about my life.

The scary part is they’re saying things I never thought of before or words that I don’t typically use. Apparenty I will be summoned to court on Friday.

I am trying to stop using and do get time up but then I relapse and this psychosis comes back but it comes in a way which is a continuation of the story not a reset which makes me think this is really all happening.

Ive managed to kick all of my drug and alcohol related addictions. Ketamine, coke, meth, tequila, oxy - anything I could get my hands on. Then I hit a relatively low patch and got into something I had never really experienced. Extreme binging and making myself throw up. This is HELL. This is the WORST addiction I have had to deal with and it's ruining my body and my brain, bank and life. 

I was doing REALLY good and was even in probably the best place I've been in in years last month. But a bad heart break threw me off completely.

I'm talking spending 2000 in a week on food to eat and throw up. It's been a month. I called out of work for a week because I was so desperate to stop the cycle but I have to go back in tomorrow and I'm panicking.

I cannot undo all my hard work. I have no money for therapy. I feel good ugly to go outside. I can hardly shower. I know if I keep going I'm going to lose my mind and harm myself. I don't really have any support or friends. I don't know what to do and I'm slip slip sliding 

I'm so desperate to stop that I've been genuinely thinking of getting coke or Adderall so I don't eat... How pathetic.

I haven't struggled with this in months and months and I'm terrified. I worked so hard to look and feel good. I know if I get back on it I'll be back where I was in a month or two which is okay.

But I can't go back to the gym if I hate how I look. I can't leave my house or shower or function AT ALL. IM TERRIFIED BECAUSE IVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
can anyone please help. I don't know what to do.

I am so so bloated and just depressed. I throw up so much that, and this is really gross and embarrassing I feel so much shame. But I piss myself. And I'll just keep going. I am in a hellish cycle only I can pull myself out of but I'm really really really having a rough time this time. I'm just watching myself undo all my love and care and hard work.

Please if someone can help with a plan or maybe be an accountability buddy or something. Please I am a good person, I am desperate and I want all addiction out of my life I cannot live addicted to food now. I can go my whole life without cocaine but I can't avoid food forever. I don't want to fall back.

It all started while I was in the Army. I attempted to end my life two times with no knowledge of why just the how. I have been put in the mental institution twice. I have tried to overcome my medical problems and to no avail. I have a constant need to use alcohol and cocaine. I should say I have a nicotine vape as well. Usually I have my episodes while on alcohol, I go through 3 phases. One of deep sadness, then extreme excitement and happiness, then anger and hate for everything. At the end of my episodes I feel miserable and want to end it all but I don’t. I feel like a coward for wanting to do that & put a burden on my family. 

Whenever I drink I am always home and don’t drink alone. I have done rehab & actively have a psychiatrist as well and therapist. In the end it always comes back to me drinking in secret & I’ll admit it isn’t a lot but it’s still a drink while in rehab. I’ve expressed my concerns to my facility and I have been able to maintain a period of abstinence but I always fall. 

My biggest issues are my relapse moments and I am afraid I might make a big mistake in my life.

reddit,1jpd2cd,addiction,2025-04-02 07:17:24,Sexually suppressed and lashing out?,"I'm a 29f, I don't know what's wrong with me. I am in the best most wholesome relationship of my entire life; he is so amazing, supportive, understanding and I genuinely do not deserve him and I cannot control myself. There is just something about sex with different partners that I can't give up. My past relationship history is that I have never been single. I have always been in a commited relationship no matter what since I was in my teens (5 years with a guy no sexual contact other than a kiss, then 6 years with my bf-> husband), to my now current relationship 6 years and counting. My only marriage I was married young, my husband was simply lazy? He was more interested in porn than he was me. That affected my mental health a lot to know that I wasn't enough for him at any given time. We ended up having an open relationship for about a year and a half towards the end where I was successful in finding male and female suitors and he was completely unsuccessful. 

I ended up finding someone during that time who genuinely cared about my mental and physical being and that was very new and confusing for me ( he is my current partner) coming from an entirely abusive childhood. Trigger warning: I'm talking childhood sexual abuse as early is 6 years old to what I am capable of remembering. I have memory issues due to trauma, I'm pretty sure I often dissociate. I don't know what's wrong with me, mental health help has a price tag on it now that I simply can't put within good conscience. ($75 a week?) 

He has said on multiple occasions that he is willing to ( reluctantly) open the relationship because he knows that something that I was accustomed to however, the stipulation being that it should be exclusively with strangers which I am really not comfortable with. I'd rather be people that I know are all right like good people, my friends. I just want to fuck my friends life is short, right?  It's bad because my friends are his friends but that's what I want. There have been some instances in which I had gotten very drunk and flirtatious with some of them openly at parties in which those occasions were all reciprocated, I'm not going to toot my own horn but I am a relatively cute individual and am pretty flirtatious by nature. 

We have incredible sex, he knows my body like it's part of his own. He knows exactly what I do and don't like, I just really enjoy the thrill of seducing someone. I can't help myself when I know that that door is opened, I have to throw myself into the door and let them know that I exist, I am real. I get satisfaction from being able to make someone finish within a minute. That has happened so often I really feel like at this point I should have an OF account based on skill alone. Nothing brings me more joy than knowing that someone has some temporary form of release. I am grateful, I am wanting, I am a terrible person. 

It has been joked that I am a horny 80 year old man in the body of a thick young Latina, my penis is bigger than most just because of my big dick energy, I've been called a succubus before just because my sexual performance is so wanting and insatiable. I feel so stunted in the fact that no one else is normally willing to put forth so much effort towards intercourse? I have been accused of not even being real before because of my overall performance. I am efficient at everything I do it is just who I am by nature, who shows up and does a half job?

I can't stop being hypersexual towards my friends. I genuinely just want to know that my friends are having a good time so I want to be the one there to provide it for them. I also find them extremely attractive not for their bodies alone but their personalities. I have always known that I ride the fence in between males and females but I definitely prefer males. I just feel bad that I'm attracted to almost anyone that I see. I'm constantly playing out fantasies in my mind about what could possibly happen and how I would handle it. I can't stop fantasizing about sexual interactions with basically everyone around me. I know that goes against everything I've said so far as far as only being comfortable with my friends but that doesn't change the fact that somehow in my mind a complete stranger would be just as good.

I absolutely cannot derive any sexual pleasure by myself, I have tried and it's never successful. My sexual enjoyment comes exclusively from knowing that someone else is enjoying themselves. I don't know what that is but that's definitely something else that's wrong with me. I have tried porn in the past and it feels so hollow and disturbing honestly. It's hard to watch, as if I have constant post but clarity, the connection is not there and it's hard to associate with. It's like I have a need for constant approval. It's starting to really suffocate me and I don't know what to do.

It's not fair to my current partner because he is so amazing and I just don't know what to do. He is fully aware that I have been in a polyamorous relationship before and it was functional, not entirely don't get me wrong. I believe it is also worth mentioning that he has said before that he's more than willing to open the relationship however I know that is not something he would enjoy. He wouldn't be able to function properly. I just want  to be single but not, I care so deeply for him and any interaction that I've had with anyone means absolutely nothing it's empty but I just want that sexual gratification. I'm being selfish and I am more than willing to continue being selfish because I have no self-control. He means everything to me I love him with every fiber of my being but I can't stop myself. What do I do? 

I have already had sex with many different people (protected) and every single time it was made very clear that it was purely a transactional fucking. No feelings, just body to body contact. No time where there ever feelings or anything involved, it still happened. He never found out. Yes, I am fully aware I am shit I tell myself that every single day. I'm just here hoping to get some advice from genuine people with experience.

Tl,Dr; I'm on the verge of breaking away from the best person I've ever had in my life for cheap thrills.

reddit,1jpadf9,addiction,2025-04-02 05:07:04,The chat that made me RETHINK success,"I had an interesting conversation the other day that's been stuck in my head ever since.

I was catching up with an old friend, who we'll refer to as James.

He's what most would consider wildly successful -- he's built and exited a massively successful company and is building another currently, has a beautiful home, the picturesque family.

Yet as we talked, I noticed his energy was low and his eyes looked tired.

And for better or worse, I don't shy away from the bigger questions.

So when I asked how things were really going, he paused for a moment.

Then, he finally said:

""I've achieved everything I set out to do... but some days I can barely drag myself out of bed.""

Despite his external results and the fact his life looked kinda ideal from the outside, it wasn't. He's been feeling increasingly disconnected from his wife over the years, and hasn't spent nearly as much time with his kids as he'd like over these years where he's been running on caffeine and stress.

And when I asked him what he does to cope with his stress, after a little digging past the surface-level responses, he revealed that he'd been using porn and alcohol as his primary ""stress relief"" for years.

In his words: ""I'm successful at everything except actually living.""

He *wanted* to be having more intimacy with his wife, spending more time with his kids, creating memories... but the reality of the situation has been really missing the mark.

This hit me hard because I've been there. Different circumstances, same fundamental issue.

Looking successful on paper while feeling empty inside.

Achieving goals that were nice, but didn't actually fulfill some of my deeper needs and desires.

And using escapism to dodge confronting that uncomfortable truth.

When I shared some of what helped me turn things around, he asked pointed questions. Dude actually listened super intently and even took a few notes.

This guy who's paid six figures to give advice was humble enough to recognize that something was off and he needed a different approach.

Three things became clear to me as we chatted:

1. External success without internal alignment is a hollow victory.
2. Even the most ""successful"" among us struggle with the same fundamental challenges. Status and wealth don't make you immune to disconnection, emptiness, or addiction.
3. A man who isn't fulfilled with and satisfied by how he's living isn't truly successful, at least not by my standards, regardless of how much he earns. There's more to life, and if our relationships, lifestyle, etc are out of whack then there's still a lot of work to be done.

It was a cool conversation.

Solid insights, and he's decided he's taking some major steps toward repairing things. Not by abandoning his career or achievements, but by reconnecting with what actually matters to him beyond wealth accumulation -- starting with his wife, and cutting down on that porn habit to help make those sparks fly again.

For men caught in similar patterns, this is often where real transformation begins.

Not necessarily with grand gestures, but with honest reflection and a willingness to change.

What areas of your life look successful on paper but feel empty in reality? And what might change if you redirected some of your energy toward creating a greater level of fulfillment?

reddit,1jp9ngm,addiction,2025-04-02 04:34:42,I disappeared entirely from my old life and relapsed after 6 months of sobriety,"I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame after all the hard work I put into rebuilding my life.

I relapsed after six months of sobriety.

The weight gain from recovery, buried emotions, emotional numbness (PAWS/anhedonia), and the stress of dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic (non-drug-related) arrest all pushed me in this direction.

And yet, I’m proud of the moves I made these past six months. Every decision was guided by professionals and outside intervention.

I moved across the country after rehab, cut off countless people (actually, everyone), and completely disappeared from my old life.

But now, I feel like I’ve just gotten better at hiding my addiction. I’m not proud of that, but I also don’t want to go back to how things were.

I went from being homeless—living in a trap house—to being graciously reintegrated into my old professional job.

Then, I had a short but intense relapse.

I’m sober again now, but I’m horrified with myself.

So much bad sh*t happened in a row. I’m struggling to process how awful it got.

It feels like I was dealt a terrible hand. And then I made some really bad decisions that led to total life collapse… and addiction.

I took accountability for my role in all of it, rebounded from the impossible, and yet—here we are again.

The thing is, I like my life right now.

But I’m so confused with myself.

I have everything going for me. And I feel ashamed.

I feel very alone.

What happened?

It’s currently 1:43 AM, and as I was listening to Broken Dreams by Shaman’s Harvest, I found myself transported back to when I was 12 years old. 

I used to listen to this song back then too, but something hit me hard tonight—I was a completely different person back then. 

I carried myself with confidence, strength, and a sense of self-respect. 

I had this natural energy inside of me that made me feel almost unstoppable.

But over the years, I fell into the grip of vices—porn, masturbation, smoking. 

And what started as habits turned into chains that drained me, both physically and mentally. 

These addictions slowly ate away at my energy, my self-esteem, and my overall well-being. 

I let them take control, and in doing so, I lost the version of myself that I once admired so deeply.

Even today, despite my deep desire to stay committed to quitting smoking, I slipped up. 

I smoked a cigarette. I vaped. And now, I’m left with that same feeling of hollowness and shame. 

I don’t want to live like this anymore and I really don’t want my addictions to dictate my life, to make me feel weak and unhealthy. 

I want to reclaim my self-respect, my confidence, and the strength I once had.

I know recovery isn’t a straight path, but I refuse to stay stuck in this rut forever.

reddit,1jp4xns,addiction,2025-04-02 01:18:36,Lost my dad last year to addiction.,"Last May I had the unfortunate and upsetting news that my dad had died. The initial response was just total shock like it didn’t even feel real what I was being told. My dad’s side reframed a fair amount of the information regarding his death as they felt it would be too much for me, I managed to get the full story and found out that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and fell into a fishing lake and drowned in the middle of the night and his body wasn’t discovered till the next following morning which I believe was Thursday morning when his body was discovered. 

Now before Dad’s death I was brought up with a lot of drugs around me. When I was a teenager I had zero tolerance with drugs would never touch them or consider doing them. As I was enjoying my school activities and hobbies outside of school. I also understood the detrimental effects it has on that person and the people around them. Then when I went to college/uni I started experimenting a bit as most people do at that age and I found it really fun made me confident, made me forget the things in my life that was causing me stress, anxiety, it almost was like a type of medicine but only gives you a short term fix on the problem. FYI I am referring to the Class A drug Cocaine. 

Moving into the start of my adult years and cocaine is still something I’ve done on numerous occasions it starts off just once a month for big social event or celebration of some kind. Then before you know it that once a month has now jumped two times a month, then I start to think about it when i go to my local pub on a random Wednesday then all of sudden I’m fancying a bag. The crazy thing is why would I give into these impulses as I’ve literally seen what it did to my dad and the end result for him. But I still go ahead and do it. I’m aware of all the warning signs I know when it becomes a problem when you’re relying on substance I learnt that the hard way by having to look after an alcoholic all through my child hood. But I still decide to do it myself as well even tho I know full well how bad it can get. 

Since my dad’s death my intake of cocaine has gone up. It’s no longer for social events it’s just me on my own taking it just because i want it. Or I will finish work on a random Tuesday and I will already have it in my head that I am going to get a G when I go home. It’s not even social any more it’s just me isolating myself and doing coke on my own. Now I don’t know why the intake has gone up so much and maybe it is the grief of my dad’s death and I didn’t even notice I was taken more cocaine, maybe it’s a coping mechanism. But it’s gotten to a point now where i am starting to get worried as I feel like the codependency and the need for it is strong and I really don’t want to go down the same rabbit hole my dad went down, cause at the end of the day it’s death. 

Who ever got this far thank you for reading this. This is my first ever time putting something up on Reddit and of course It had to be something like this. I’m not really sure how this works if people can comment or help in any way but I just wanted to write it all out basically. 

Thank you. 

 
 ",Lost my dad last year to addiction Last May I had the unfortunate and upsetting news that my dad had died The initial response was just total shock like it didn t even feel real what I was being told My dad s side reframed a fair amount of the information regarding his death as they felt it would be too much for me I managed to get the full story and found out that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and fell into a fishing lake and drowned in the middle of the night and his body wasn t discovered till the next following morning which I believe was Thursday morning when his body was discovered Now before Dad s death I was brought up with a lot of drugs around me When I was a teenager I had zero tolerance with drugs would never touch them or consider doing them As I was enjoying my school activities and hobbies outside of school I also understood the detrimental effects it has on that person and the people around them Then when I went to college uni I started experimenting a bit as most people do at that age and I found it really fun made me confident made me forget the things in my life that was causing me stress anxiety it almost was like a type of medicine but only gives you a short term fix on the problem FYI I am referring to the Class A drug Cocaine Moving into the start of my adult years and cocaine is still something I ve done on numerous occasions it starts off just once a month for big social event or celebration of some kind Then before you know it that once a month has now jumped two times a month then I start to think about it when i go to my local pub on a random Wednesday then all of sudden I m fancying a bag The crazy thing is why would I give into these impulses as I ve literally seen what it did to my dad and the end result for him But I still go ahead and do it I m aware of all the warning signs I know when it becomes a problem when you re relying on substance I learnt that the hard way by having to look after an alcoholic all through my child hood But I still decide to do it myself as well even tho I know full well how bad it can get Since my dad s death my intake of cocaine has gone up It s no longer for social events it s just me on my own taking it just because i want it Or I will finish work on a random Tuesday and I will already have it in my head that I am going to get a G when I go home It s not even social any more it s just me isolating myself and doing coke on my own Now I don t know why the intake has gone up so much and maybe it is the grief of my dad s death and I didn t even notice I was taken more cocaine maybe it s a coping mechanism But it s gotten to a point now where i am starting to get worried as I feel like the codependency and the need for it is strong and I really don t want to go down the same rabbit hole my dad went down cause at the end of the day it s death Who ever got this far thank you for reading this This is my first ever time putting something up on Reddit and of course It had to be something like this I m not really sure how this works if people can comment or help in any way but I just wanted to write it all out basically Thank you,4,1,the middle of the night and his body wasn,Alert-Frame-4889,https://reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jp4xns/lost_my_dad_last_year_to_addiction/,-0.9706,0.062126068376068384,Moderate,Negative

Started even doing it in toilets at work and getting minis on my way there. Feel like my childhood trauma + falling in with friends who did drugs very early in life (about 13 yrs old) has made me the way I am and idk what to do.

Tried CBT but basically got told I’m too fucked up for it and need to address my issues through counselling first which I’m starting next week. I’ve been unofficially diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I have always felt like there are way deeper issues which I have (likely due to growing up around alcoholics, multiple close family suicides/attempts, witnessing parents physical and mental abuse as well as sometimes being the victim of it, seeing parents get arrested, restraining orders etc.) and it is very hard to get a diagnosis in Scotland. I have worked so hard through my struggles to get educated with pretty much 0 support, and now that I am on my way up it’s like all this shit has hit me. I have always dabbled in drugs but never to this point, and I have been going on the way I am for a few months now. Likely it got caused by my dad’s relapse about a year ago that really triggered those childhood feelings.

reddit,1jonajd,addiction,2025-04-01 10:01:57,Seeking advice for parents,"I’m reaching out with a heavy heart to ask for advice for my elderly parents ( Father: 64 age and Mother: 60 age, living in India) who are going through a very painful time at home. My father is doing business and my mother is housewife.

My brother has been struggling with addiction (codeine syrup and sleeping pills) for years. Despite two -three rehab attempts, he keeps relapsing. We’re now planning to send him for long-term rehab (1–2 years), hoping this will help him recover. Also he has diabetes.

What makes things even harder is my brother’s wife. She regularly speaks disrespectfully to my parents, uses hurtful language, and shows no willingness to live peacefully. And yet, my parents have always treated her with kindness and respect. She lives Mon-Fri here and sat- Sun her parents house. My parents have even told her that if she feels unhappy in this life, she is free to make her own decisions—even to consider a second marriage if it would bring her peace and a better future for herself and the child or also stay here peacefully, but she doesn’t take any decisions maybe because of society shame. Even after speaking with her family, there’s been no improvement, as they too fear societal judgment.

Though both he and his wife work, they don’t contribute to household expenses. My parents are homeowner and, despite age and health, still covers all the costs. My mother takes care of their child full-time.

We’ve thought about legal steps, but we’re held back by community gossip and inexperience with such matters. We’re a simple family, and we’ve never faced anything like this before. Right now, our main concern is the emotional health of our parents, also her.

If anyone has faced a similar situation or can offer guidance—especially on how to emotionally and practically support elderly parents—we would truly appreciate your insight. We’re also open to hearing any legal advice that could help protect our parents’ rights and bring peace to the home, while handling things as respectfully as possible.

reddit,1jowwqq,addiction,2025-04-01 19:56:42,Does anyone else feel like they just chase stimulation for no reason at all? Like normal life just isn’t enough? Were you able to find peace in sobriety?,"I recently started on Vyvanse for ADHD. The Vyvanse was amazing - too amazing. As soon as I was prescribed I was playing with my dose, and while I was productive at first very few quickly I was taking it and just gaming and doomscrolling all day. 

After two months of always craving more despite trying varying doses I told my psychiatrist that it was making me crave more and feel like a junkie + seemed to be making my ADHD worse. 

We decided to try methylphenidate which I’ve been on for the past week and while I have never exceeded dosage guidelines, I have been increasing the dose fairly quickly and finding I only ‘feel good’ for maybe 2 hours and once again want more, like it’s ’never enough’. Methylphenidate in particular just makes me extremely anxious at higher doses so it’s clearly not for me. I’m going to have to tell her this isn’t working either and try non-stimulant options. 

I just feel pretty defeated. I’ve struggled with ADHD my whole life and only got diagnosed recently at 31. I also have an addictive personality and the flavour of my addiction changes like the seasons. It moves between gaming, to eating, to porn, to binge drinking (although just socially), to shopping, to nicotine, and recently it’s felt like I’ve been flirting a dangerous line with stimulants. I hoped that getting medicated would fix my struggles with addiction, not make them worse. 

When I read of other people’s struggles with addiction 90% of the time either they just need to beat the physical dependence and they’re good, or there’s an underlying trauma or mental health issue which once they ‘solve’ they stop struggling. But for me it’s just like I get addicted to anything that makes me feel good, and there never seems to be a point where I feel content with ‘just a bit’ of something good. Moderation of anything feels impossible and I was hoping medicating my ADHD would fix that. 

Does anyone else here struggle with this? Were you able to find peace? I’ve gone through months where I kick all my bad habits and exercise, meditate, and eat well, and I feel good but it’s like I have to be laser focused on good habits or it all just goes to shit.

i have a close family member that smokes.

i think i need to 'save' them.

but i know that ultimately, the more i push, the harder they resist.

i know the best thing is to simply be there for them.

but that's f-ing hard to do.

i tell myself, its not my job to figure their life out

i realise it comes from a deep part of me, a part that wants to be seen as helping people.

a part that believes self-worth is tied to the action of 'saving'

and if i dont 'save' then i am unworthy.

i have since worked a lot on this part. it doesn't control me, but i still feel it. i still hear it.

and yes, sometimes it does get the better of me, and i offer advice when i should not.

i think being aware of this helps, and so i wanted to share with you guys.

and even that in itself can be seen as me wanting to 'save' someone out there...

maybe i should have posted this in r/DeepThoughts instead!

just something i have been experiencing recently.

\*Edit: To give some status as to the who, what, and why. I can't quit bc it makes all the pain from watching my wife's final moments, the memory is forever burned into my brain. She was my everything, and it was the worst night of my life forever. It makes me forget why I don't have my own house anymore, why I've been stuck at my parents for almost a year, why I didn't work for months or leave my house, until I got a job at my local vape shop one day when I was feeling better and had no success at landing any job. I was a former video editor and have worked for a few major companies. But it takes all I have to just pull my pants on and go to work, it does make me feel better and I love the job bc I'm injured from a car accident and currently getting medical help through a law firm, one of the reasons why I can't quit, super flexible and permanent hours with a super understanding boss, that's really hard to find nowadays. It sucks that I have users coming in to buy meth bowls or talking about hot railing if we don't, just them being there reminds me of how the rush feels. I started as an excuse that since I have ADHD and Adderall is not a potent but in the same family, so I would just use less and I would eat it or snort it to get that ADHD medication effect, that I've learned is a lie and always will be. Idk if Adderall really works with someone that has ADHD as severe as me it makes me focus and all that but not on stuff I need to, gives me energy, I have plenty of that, Klonopin slows my mind down, allows me to think and not talk over people, I do that on and off of ADHD meds or I'm a zombie that doesn't eat or socialize. Kinda how I felt as a kid when I was diagnosed with it and ASD-1. Just to be flat out here, I fucking hate my life, I hate everything, and none of it was my fault, I would have my house back and my wonderful wife, this took everything from me it destroyed me seeing her in her own creation, one second she was my wife now she's gone, it was like a fuck you to the world and me. She left her problems here when she did, and made 1000 more for everyone else, especially me, to escape that's why.

What do I feel like now? I can't stop scratching my beard and face, I have to stop myself from chewing on my lip and grinding my teeth. Sleep would be out the question without my Ambien (which I took about 20 min ago, current time 4:54am). Appetite, still almost non-existent I'm still forcing myself to eat and drink. I get in my car or room, basically anywhere I've used and I immediately take my phone out and turn on the flashlight and I gotta stop myself bc I'm looking for shards that aren't there. I feel like I wanna just rail a line or smoke a bowl to make these feelings stop. But I don't wanna chase the dragon anymore. I might be able to hide my habit now, but dependency is defiantly forming in some way.

Current age 33 I feel the slippery slope of addiction and relapse. To start off I'll begin with the first time I did meth wasn't intentional age 20, idk if my friend knew or didn't all I know is he called me told me he had some girl and if I wanna bang out some gators, hell yeah its Friday. He gets there and we always were smart and would use a bump tool to test it, see how good it was, or if it was actually coke, he said ""house rules, the host gets the first bump"", at the time someone I felt as being a close friend this wasn't ominous foreshadowing, if he knew, well I could tell 100% the instant that powder hit my nose that was not coke, then nearly immediately I felt like I was going lightspeed and I could do anything, I also knew that it was meth the way it burned was like molten dragon piss in powder form or something. I guess being the ""good"" friend, I say it with quotes bc he became an addict immediately after so I'm not sure, he was he said something like ""fuck dude, I guess Imma ride it with ya"" Then it was 2 days of gacked the fuck out, I hated it bc all I could do after he left for the next 8 hours was lay in bed and try to jerk off with zero result(clarity I doubt it was 8 hours, but it was long enough I'll say that). I guess you're all wondering how'd he not know by looking at it that it wasn't coke, well it was 100% shake-and-bake all white powder and not enough light for me to really tell, I know bc at the time and a few years prior I would cook and sell with a friends dad, I knew this was a good way to make quick money, but I promised I never do it bc I saw how just an average, not tweaker meth head looked, and trust me a lot of average users in my state look a step up from a well known website and project that posts a lot of before and after photos. A few years went by(24-25) and one night hanging out with 2 longtime close friends, I arrive and a pookie soon comes out, I just say fuck it and try it they roll it for me and I got a good strong hit, felt like the last time I did it honestly, I think it was either trash meth or they weren't they best at rolling(I'll get to why I think that soon), chilled with them from probably 830pm to 5am, was able to goto bed just fine. Woke up no cravings nothing, good to go like the last time. Nothing and I mean absolutely no amphetamine or meth use, I was very much against it. Flash forward 8 years give or take, May 12, 2024 my wife committed suicide right in front of me, she did not die from her final act and I tried to save her but I knew there was too much damage, I agreed with the doctor that with her 10% brain function and constant seizures, and on life support, my wife was no longer with me I would never have her back in anyway, so after 3 days I said okay to them taking her off, she took her last breath 27 min later. First everything was what you'd expect from that kind of grief and PTSD, my parents pay for my therapy bc I knew I wouldn't be able to function without it. Its been working fairly well since my therapist has PTSD from being in Global War on Terror as a combat medic, she was one of the first women they allowed to go on major combat missions during major pushes during the 2nd invasion of Ramadi, she saw a lot. So she only treats vets and suicide survivors like myself through EDMR style therapy and I go to group every month. Everything has been getting better very slowly but far better than almost a year ago. I have always smoked weed everyday so that's not new and my consumption didn't increase. I drank a little for the first month to month and a half after her passing but that like all the other habits I've ever had I can just go nah not anymore and I'm done no cravings, withdraws, etc. Now were gonna go to late February of this year I for some reason met out of ALLLLLL the meth users that come into my store to buy ""oil burners"" chose one guy to ask if he had some shard or could get some, he didn't look like your typical tweaker that would come in there, he was normal looking, acted normal, but was def a more than occasional user, he said yes and gave me his number, when I got paid a day later my dumbass went and got a gram from him, while I was there we smoked a bowl and I finally felt ""the flash"", didn't realize it that was set it's hooks into me. But I didn't smoke, I thought I could get away with snorting it and eating it in small amounts for a short time to fix my sleep, I absolutely did not do that. A week goes by of not doing any of that, get paid call him again to try again, smoked and then snorted the rest, no issues with eating or sleep but did not fix sleep schedule. Another week maybe week and a half go by and I call him again this time I did it bc I wanted some, mistake #1, I buy it and a bowl and smoke with him and while I'm going about my day but I still keep it minimal and I'm really shit about rolling a bowl so I burn it most of the time and decide to go back to snorting just more at a time. Few days go by and now I buy it to repeat the high, I spent the day with him fishing and smoking meth and bought 3 grams this time. I smoked all 3 grams in 5 days, I would account the first half a gram as wasted bc I burnt the shit out of it, then I turned to trusty reddit on how to properly smoke meth, well I sure as hell figured it out now and I was rolling almost perfect every time. And I smoked and I smoked during the 5 days I slept twice for about 10 hours total and ate 3 out of the 5 days and I did and always do stayed hydrated. Only this time when I ran out, it wasn't like the last 4 times where I just got sleepy and went to bed, I went into tweaker mode, carpet shard goblin and all. And about halfway though the day of this I'm finally like wtf are you doing? STOP NOW. Thank god for being prescribed an SSRI and Klonopin bc It's been 24 hours, I had a full day of sleep(10 hours) I ate 3 meals, been hydrating and I'm still having a hard time, still gritting my teeth, still craving finding myself when I go look for something I'll catch myself ""shard hunting"" for a second and I'm like dude fucking cut it out. Problem is this guy is a regular, and even though he'll be more than understanding about why I can't hang out with him anymore, I can't quit my job its not an option, but I can't stop the meth users coming in there to get bowls all the time or dude coming in to get cigs every other day. I have to keep this job and stay clean. Please give me advice on what to do and ways to mentally fortify myself, I don't want that crap about ""just stay strong"" or ""just say no""...duh, I wanna know what would you do as an ex user or addict in my shoes to prevent this, that's gonna give me a better idea on what to do. I know I can just I need your comments to be memories I can pull from to relate to bc it will give me strength.

who what and why I can t quit bc it makes all the pain from watching my wife s final moments the memory is forever burned into my brain She was my everything and it was the worst night of my life forever It makes me forget why I don t have my own house anymore why I ve been stuck at my parents for almost a year why I didn t work for months or leave my house until I got a job at my local vape shop one day when I was feeling better and had no success at landing any job I was a former video editor and have worked for a few major companies But it takes all I have to just pull my pants on and go to work it does make me feel better and I love the job bc I m injured from a car accident and currently getting medical help through a law firm one of the reasons why I can t quit super flexible and permanent hours with a super understanding boss that s really hard to find nowadays It sucks that I have users coming in to buy meth bowls or talking about hot railing if we don t just them being there reminds me of how the rush feels I started as an excuse that since I have ADHD and Adderall is not a potent but in the same family so I would just use less and I would eat it or snort it to get that ADHD medication effect that I ve learned is a lie and always will be Idk if Adderall really works with someone that has ADHD as severe as me it makes me focus and all that but not on stuff I need to gives me energy I have plenty of that Klonopin slows my mind down allows me to think and not talk over people I do that on and off of ADHD meds or I m a zombie that doesn t eat or socialize Kinda how I felt as a kid when I was diagnosed with it and ASD 1 Just to be flat out here I fucking hate my life I hate everything and none of it was my fault I would have my house back and my wonderful wife this took everything from me it destroyed me seeing her in her own creation one second she was my wife now she s gone it was like a fuck you to the world and me She left her problems here when she did and made 1000 more for everyone else especially me to escape that s why What do I feel like now I can t stop scratching my beard and face I have to stop myself from chewing on my lip and grinding my teeth Sleep would be out the question without my Ambien which I took about 20 min ago current time 4 54am Appetite still almost non existent I m still forcing myself to eat and drink I get in my car or room basically anywhere I ve used and I immediately take my phone out and turn on the flashlight and I gotta stop myself bc I m looking for shards that aren t there I feel like I wanna just rail a line or smoke a bowl to make these feelings stop But I don t wanna chase the dragon anymore I might be able to hide my habit now but dependency is defiantly forming in some way Current age 33 I feel the slippery slope of addiction and relapse To start off I ll begin with the first time I did meth wasn t intentional age 20 idk if my friend knew or didn t all I know is he called me told me he had some girl and if I wanna bang out some gators hell yeah its Friday He gets there and we always were smart and would use a bump tool to test it see how good it was or if it was actually coke he said house rules the host gets the first bump at the time someone I felt as being a close friend this wasn t ominous foreshadowing if he knew well I could tell 100 the instant that powder hit my nose that was not coke then nearly immediately I felt like I was going lightspeed and I could do anything I also knew that it was meth the way it burned was like molten dragon piss in powder form or something I guess being the good friend I say it with quotes bc he became an addict immediately after so I m not sure he was he said something like fuck dude I guess Imma ride it with ya Then it was 2 days of gacked the fuck out I hated it bc all I could do after he left for the next 8 hours was lay in bed and try to jerk off with zero result clarity I doubt it was 8 hours but it was long enough I ll say that I guess you re all wondering how d he not know by looking at it that it wasn t coke well it was 100 shake and bake all white powder and not enough light for me to really tell I know bc at the time and a few years prior I would cook and sell with a friends dad I knew this was a good way to make quick money but I promised I never do it bc I saw how just an average not tweaker meth head looked and trust me a lot of average users in my state look a step up from a well known website and project that posts a lot of before and after photos A few years went by 24 25 and one night hanging out with 2 longtime close friends I arrive and a pookie soon comes out I just say fuck it and try it they roll it for me and I got a good strong hit felt like the last time I did it honestly I think it was either trash meth or they weren t they best at rolling I ll get to why I think that soon chilled with them from probably 830pm to 5am was able to goto bed just fine Woke up no cravings nothing good to go like the last time Nothing and I mean absolutely no amphetamine or meth use I was very much against it Flash forward 8 years give or take May 12 2024 my wife committed suicide right in front of me she did not die from her final act and I tried to save her but I knew there was too much damage I agreed with the doctor that with her 10 brain function and constant seizures and on life support my wife was no longer with me I would never have her back in anyway so after 3 days I said okay to them taking her off she took her last breath 27 min later First everything was what you d expect from that kind of grief and PTSD my parents pay for my therapy bc I knew I wouldn t be able to function without it Its been working fairly well since my therapist has PTSD from being in Global War on Terror as a combat medic she was one of the first women they allowed to go on major combat missions during major pushes during the 2nd invasion of Ramadi she saw a lot So she only treats vets and suicide survivors like myself through EDMR style therapy and I go to group every month Everything has been getting better very slowly but far better than almost a year ago I have always smoked weed everyday so that s not new and my consumption didn t increase I drank a little for the first month to month and a half after her passing but that like all the other habits I ve ever had I can just go nah not anymore and I m done no cravings withdraws etc Now were gonna go to late February of this year I for some reason met out of ALLLLLL the meth users that come into my store to buy oil burners chose one guy to ask if he had some shard or could get some he didn t look like your typical tweaker that would come in there he was normal looking acted normal but was def a more than occasional user he said yes and gave me his number when I got paid a day later my dumbass went and got a gram from him while I was there we smoked a bowl and I finally felt the flash didn t realize it that was set it s hooks into me But I didn t smoke I thought I could get away with snorting it and eating it in small amounts for a short time to fix my sleep I absolutely did not do that A week goes by of not doing any of that get paid call him again to try again smoked and then snorted the rest no issues with eating or sleep but did not fix sleep schedule Another week maybe week and a half go by and I call him again this time I did it bc I wanted some mistake 1 I buy it and a bowl and smoke with him and while I m going about my day but I still keep it minimal and I m really shit about rolling a bowl so I burn it most of the time and decide to go back to snorting just more at a time Few days go by and now I buy it to repeat the high I spent the day with him fishing and smoking meth and

reddit,1joo7rt,addiction,2025-04-01 11:01:21,A Letter to My Drug Addicted Mother,"Hello everyone. I hope all is well. My names Josie Kelley. I wrote my mom a letter after I had blocked her, and sent it by mail. She never ended up reading it. I want someone to see my heart. I know people in this community struggle with addiction. I know they struggle with many things. My heart goes out to all of you. Even if no one reads this, I want to put my heart on a platter from the daughters perspective of addiction. What I wrote below, it's what I desperately wished my mom knew when she thought I hated her.

Mama,

I know it’s weird to send a letter like this when we live in a day and age where phones and cars exist. I know I’ve made it hard for you to get in contact with me in those ways, but I needed to get my feelings out. Lately, and probably a lot of my life, it’s been hard for us to communicate with each other. Maybe it’s because we’re the only girls, or that we’re so alike, or maybe it’s just simply how life goes for two people who feel things so deeply. I hope you’ll read my full letter and its entirety. I had to type it out because I have a lot in my heart that I wish I could tell you. I have a lot of things that I want to get off of my chest. Please take the time to read it. I want to start off by telling you how much I love you, mama. I love you so much that sometimes I stay up at night and cry thinking that one day I’ll never see you again. I’ll cry thinking about how I haven’t seen you and that I miss you. I miss you so much. I don’t think I could put into words how I feel about you, mama. Out of every person on this Earth, I love you the most. I feel so complete when I’m with you. To me, you’re my safe place, you’re my home. You make me so happy, like a warm childish feeling. I could go without everything in the world if that meant I could be with you. I know I could handle losing some people, but I can’t handle losing you. I don’t ever stay up praying for someone like I stay up to pray about you. I don’t ever miss anyone but you. I don’t ever cry over being away from anyone but you. You mean so much to me, I don’t know how anyone could live without you.

Despite what you might think, I tell everyone how amazing my mama is, and how wonderfully she raised me. When I moved out, I cried myself to sleep every night because I wanted to be at home with you. I know that may sound conflicting to you because I’m the one that decided to leave, but I couldn’t stay there anymore. I wish that things were a bit more simple. I wish things were a lot more black and white between us. Between everyone in our family. Out of every person, I feel a connection to you that I can’t even begin to explain. I love my mama. I love you so much. I feel in my heart that you’re the most special woman in the world. You’re the most kind, the most funny, the most caring, the most beautiful, the most warm, and the most amazing person ever to exist. Despite how you may think I feel towards you, in my heart of hearts, you have all of me. You truly are the one who taught me how to love and to be loved. You did everything you could for me. You are everything to me. I love you with all of my soul that it hurts to think you aren’t here with me like you used to be. I wish we still had our family together. I think about you all the time. I know you think I talk badly of you, but if there's one thing I can say, it’s that I don’t want anyone thinking wrongly of you. When you do something, I know I can understand it. I know I can see what you were trying to do. Even though I can’t show you that, that’s how I feel in my heart. It’s so hard for me to show you any vulnerability or sympathy. It’s so hard for me to give you the comfort you need when you’re sad. It’s so hard for me to tell you that I know what you’re going through. I know I can feel your struggle, I don’t want anyone to get the wrong impression of you no matter what you’ve done. They don’t know you like I know you, why would I tell them anything that you did? Why would I bad mouth you? You hold so much of my heart Mom. I want our family to love each other. I don’t tell all of the drama to Justin like you think, or vice versa. We rarely speak about family.

How could I tell people who don’t understand you anything negative about you? You’re wonderful. You’re amazing. You’re truly the apple of my eye, mama. You are the best thing to ever happen to me. Why would I want someone else to think you weren’t precious? I don’t tell anyone anything. I don’t go out of my way to ruin things for you. I don’t go off and tell everyone the drama. I don’t think I’m better than you. I could never be the woman that you are or go through the things that you have. You are so strong. You are so thoughtful and willing to help others. You are very selfless. Why would I think I’m better than you? I know you feel like I think that, but it’s just not true. I look up to you in many ways, I know that you’re trying your best to keep everything together and I know that you’re the only one doing that. I would never think I’m better than you. You’re living a hard life. You’re doing very emotionally draining things. How could I think I’m better than you when you do something so rigorous? You’re a strong woman. A beautiful woman. You are a prize to be treasured. There’s no such thing as someone better than you. You have to believe me for a moment when I say that. There's not a part of me that looks down on you, or Dad, or Colbie in the sense that I believe I’m better. I think a lot of times, the two of us get lost in translation. We go off of what we believe the situation is rather than what it truly is. I don’t think I’m more righteous than you. I wish I could do more for you. I wish I could help you and make you happier. I wish I could be someone you could rely on more. I’m sorry I couldn’t give you that comfort. I’m sorry I’ve turned you away so many times. I’m sorry for all the times that I’ve been ungrateful. I’m sorry for being so rude to you and being so mean to you, mama. I’m sorry for not appreciating you more or making you feel like you weren’t good enough. I’m sorry for not giving you a shoulder to cry on or giving you the comfort you needed. I’m sorry that I wasn’t able to hold you when you needed it. I’m sorry for hurting your feelings intentionally and all the many times I did it unintentionally. You deserved a tender heart from me, but I was blind a lot of times to my words or to how you felt. I was blinded by my own pain and anger. I’m sorry for any time I’ve lied to you, any time that I’ve made you feel unhappy, any time that I made you feel like I was looking down on you. I’m sorry for anything I’ve done to come against you or hurt you. I’m so sorry from the bottom of my heart. I’m sorry, mama.

I want you to be happy. I wish I could have been a lot better in the times where I wasn’t good enough. I want nothing but the best for you. I wish that I could take all of your pain away and I wish that I could press a button and have all of our issues wiped away, I wish our family could go back to normal. In this letter, I may say some things that you don’t agree with, but please, for me, please just read what I have to say. Please. I know things in our lives have taken a turn for the worse and it’s like a rollercoaster continuing to push forward in the wrong direction. Our family fell apart so quickly that it was hard to stop it. In reality, when I think about it, it’s all in slow motion. The slow grinding down of every one. I know that our family has struggled with many things, and I know that it’s hard to pinpoint it all. I come to you earnestly mom, I just want you to be honest with me. I just want you to give me some closure and something real. I need that from you Mom. Please. Please allow me this. I know. I know about a lot of things. I know and I don’t know. I know there are things that I’ll never know. You need to be honest with yourself. I know. I’m not trying to judge you, Mom. I’m not trying to hurt you. I just want my mama back so badly. I know you think it’s fine and I know you think things aren’t caused by what you’re doing. But they have been for a long time. This letter isn’t about Dad, but I know he's done more than his fair share of it too. It’s not that I’m just blaming you mama, but you don’t understand what I feel for you. I don’t feel the same things with Dad. I know it feels like I always let him off the hook or am being nicer to him, but it’s because I don’t expect him to do anything else. I expect so much from you because I know what you’re capable of. 

I don’t understand it myself. I don’t know why it’s so much easier to talk to Dad, or why it feels like I can forgive him so easily when I know deep down he’s nothing compared to you. Don’t get me wrong, I love Dad to pieces, but you... You were my mom and my dad for so much of my life. You were always there for me and raised me in the most loving, gentle, and warmest way possible. You did it perfectly, mama. I’m so proud of you. You held me when I cried, you rubbed my feet when they hurt, and you kissed my knees when I fell. You stayed with me. You loved me, you nursed me back to health when I was sick, you made me laugh when I was sad, you played games with me when I was bored. How could anyone be a better mother than you? You’re my person. It’s so much harder for me to forgive you. It’s so much harder for me to speak to you freely. It’s so hard for me because I just want to express to you how much I love you but I can’t help but hold things against you. I can’t help but be mad at you. I’m sorry about that. Something different about him, he’ll be honest with me, even if it’s just a little. He’ll apologize because he knows he’s an addict. An alcoholic. You’re so much more than these drugs, mama. Then those people who are claiming to have your back. Dad is more than the alcohol and addiction too. But you're something special mama. You’re so special. You’re like diamonds and gold, how can anyone be better than you? You’re more than all of this. You’re my world. I can’t help but hold everything against you because I want my mommy so badly. I want the mother who had that soft heart. I want the mother who wasn’t weighed down by the world. I want you. I want you back. I know that these drugs talk for you a lot of the time. I know it feels like you’re in a car with no breaks. I know things are happening so naturally around you that it’s hard to think that these drugs are the issue. I know that mama. I don’t blame you for being addicted. I don’t blame you for hustling. I don’t blame you for living the life that you feel was dealt to you. I don’t blame you for those things, and I don’t hold them against you. I don’t think you’re a bad person. I don’t think you’re disgusting. I don’t think you’re worthless. I don’t think that you’re unsavable. You’re more than any drug in this world, any lifestyle in this world. I don’t blame you for those things. I blame you for not facing those facts though. I blame you for not being honest with yourself and with me. I blame you for not having the dignity to realize that you’re not hiding the truth from anyone. You hurt others more by simply pretending you aren’t doing what you are. If you aren’t ashamed to do it in secret, you shouldn’t be ashamed to do it openly. I know. It’s not hard to tell. I can tell when you’re high. I can tell when you’re sober. I can’t tell every time you lie, but I know you do. Please just be honest with me. Please show me that. Please, mama.

I have suffered a lot in my childhood, but I know many people have. I have gone through a lot of pain in my life, but I know many people have. I know that things and life aren’t always normal. I wish you could be honest with me. If you would give me that, it would be so much easier for me to forgive you and have us move on. We don’t have to live like this forever. Our family doesn’t have to suffer forever. It starts with being honest. You need help. There's nothing wrong with that. I just want things to change and move on from this, I want to grow our lives and be together again. I want to come over to the house and feel welcomed again. I want to see you and feel loved again. I want to hold you and feel like a kid again. I want to show you my heart and not feel scared that you’ll get high again. I want you to leave the drugs behind. I want you to be able to start a new life that you can actually be happy in. I want you back. I want these drugs to die and go to hell.

I know that when I moved out, you had a lot of thoughts about it. I know you thought someone was influencing me. The truth of that is Mom, I’m hardly swayed by others. Every time I confront you or try to talk to you about things that have happened, you always act like its other people who tell me what to say, but that’s simply not true. I have never been moved to say something I don’t believe. I have never been moved to hate you. People don’t talk about you as much as you think they do. When I would come over here to Nana's house before I moved out, none of us would speak on you or whatever situation was going on. We moved out to get away from all of that. I have always driven my own ship. I have always formed my own opinions. Nothing I have ever said to you was brought out by someone else. Justin never talks badly of you, in fact, he only talks about how much he loves you and wishes you would get the help you need. Same for Nana. We defend you more than most people do. It’s not fair for you to blame us in that way. When everything happened after the 4th of July, it wasn’t anyone else’s choice but my own to leave. I had warned you for months that I was going to move out if you and Dad didn’t change, but nothing happened. You didn’t believe me.  I told you in December that things needed to change or I wasn’t staying. The months went on. I tried to bring it up but nothing ever happened when I did. January, nothing. February, nothing. March, nothing. April, nothing. May, nothing. June, nothing. I couldn’t take it anymore. Both you and Dad refused to get the help you needed. The help I begged you to get. I want you to be happy Mom. I want you and Dad to change for the better. I’m sick of this life we seem to be stuck to. The last two years of our lives have felt like... honestly, hell. Alcohol, drugs, anger, violence, manipulation, and more have infested the structure of our family. I wanted change. I needed it. I begged for it. I tried to talk to you about it, I tried to warn you about it, but you would turn me away and get mad. You told me that I wasn’t going to move out. I realized you told me that you wanted the same change as me just so I’d shut up. You guys didn’t even falter when I told you I would leave. You were shocked when I actually did and blamed everyone but yourselves. You and dad. You had six months.

Do you think I wanted to move out mom? Do you think as a 17 year old that I wanted to pay my own bills? To burden the people around me to take me back and forth to work and school? To make all of my choices by myself? Do you think I wanted to be away from my home and my family? I was a child.. I forced myself to grow up and get somewhere that didn’t feel like a house of darkness and depression. I’ve done so much myself and I deserve some credit for that. I don’t deserve you blaming me for leaving. I don’t deserve you treating me like some spoiled brat. I don’t deserve you treating me like I think I’m better than you because I want more for myself. I didn’t deserve how much you guys put on me. I’m your daughter, not your emotional scapegoat. I’m not the one that’s supposed to bring happiness to the house and carry the burden of everyone's depression either. I don’t deserve you belittling me. I handle EVERYTHING on my own. I do EVERYTHING on my own. 

I tried my hardest to keep our relationship after I moved out. I’m the one who came to see y'all, I’m the one who called and texted y'all, I’m the one who forgave y'all. You guys wouldn’t let it go, you guys wouldn’t treat me equally, you guys made me feel like an outsider. That wasn’t fair to me. For the first month after moving out, it felt like I was mourning my family. It felt like I was mourning you. I cried and cried and cried. I laid in bed and sobbed myself to sleep every night because I didn’t have my mom. I want you back mom. I don’t want the drugs. I’ve forgiven you time and time again, the least you could give me is a little respect and honesty. If you want to be honest with me, I’ll always listen. I’ll never judge what you’ve done.

",A Letter to My Drug Addicted Mother Hello everyone I hope all is well My names Josie Kelley I wrote my mom a letter after I had blocked her and sent it by mail She never ended up reading it I want someone to see my heart I know people in this community struggle with addiction I know they struggle with many things My heart goes out to all of you Even if no one reads this I want to put my heart on a platter from the daughters perspective of addiction What I wrote below it s what I desperately wished my mom knew when she thought I hated her Mama I know it s weird to send a letter like this when we live in a day and age where phones and cars exist I know I ve made it hard for you to get in contact with me in those ways but I needed to get my feelings out Lately and probably a lot of my life it s been hard for us to communicate with each other Maybe it s because we re the only girls or that we re so alike or maybe it s just simply how life goes for two people who feel things so deeply I hope you ll read my full letter and its entirety I had to type it out because I have a lot in my heart that I wish I could tell you I have a lot of things that I want to get off of my chest Please take the time to read it I want to start off by telling you how much I love you mama I love you so much that sometimes I stay up at night and cry thinking that one day I ll never see you again I ll cry thinking about how I haven t seen you and that I miss you I miss you so much I don t think I could put into words how I feel about you mama Out of every person on this Earth I love you the most I feel so complete when I m with you To me you re my safe place you re my home You make me so happy like a warm childish feeling I could go without everything in the world if that meant I could be with you I know I could handle losing some people but I can t handle losing you I don t ever stay up praying for someone like I stay up to pray about you I don t ever miss anyone but you I don t ever cry over being away from anyone but you You mean so much to me I don t know how anyone could live without you Despite what you might think I tell everyone how amazing my mama is and how wonderfully she raised me When I moved out I cried myself to sleep every night because I wanted to be at home with you I know that may sound conflicting to you because I m the one that decided to leave but I couldn t stay there anymore I wish that things were a bit more simple I wish things were a lot more black and white between us Between everyone in our family Out of every person I feel a connection to you that I can t even begin to explain I love my mama I love you so much I feel in my heart that you re the most special woman in the world You re the most kind the most funny the most caring the most beautiful the most warm and the most amazing person ever to exist Despite how you may think I feel towards you in my heart of hearts you have all of me You truly are the one who taught me how to love and to be loved You did everything you could for me You are everything to me I love you with all of my soul that it hurts to think you aren t here with me like you used to be I wish we still had our family together I think about you all the time I know you think I talk badly of you but if there s one thing I can say it s that I don t want anyone thinking wrongly of you When you do something I know I can understand it I know I can see what you were trying to do Even though I can t show you that that s how I feel in my heart It s so hard for me to show you any vulnerability or sympathy It s so hard for me to give you the comfort you need when you re sad It s so hard for me to tell you that I know what you re going through I know I can feel your struggle I don t want anyone to get the wrong impression of you no matter what you ve done They don t know you like I know you why would I tell them anything that you did Why would I bad mouth you You hold so much of my heart Mom I want our family to love each other I don t tell all of the drama to Justin like you think or vice versa We rarely speak about family How could I tell people who don t understand you anything negative about you You re wonderful You re amazing You re truly the apple of my eye mama You are the best thing to ever happen to me Why would I want someone else to think you weren t precious I don t tell anyone anything I don t go out of my way to ruin things for you I don t go off and tell everyone the drama I don t think I m better than you I could never be the woman that you are or go through the things that you have You are so strong You are so thoughtful and willing to help others You are very selfless Why would I think I m better than you I know you feel like I think that but it s just not true I look up to you in many ways I know that you re trying your best to keep everything together and I know that you re the only one doing that I would never think I m better than you You re living a hard life You re doing very emotionally draining things How could I think I m better than you when you do something so rigorous You re a strong woman A beautiful woman You are a prize to be treasured There s no such thing as someone better than you You have to believe me for a moment when I say that There s not a part of me that looks down on you or Dad or Colbie in the sense that I believe I m better I think a lot of times the two of us get lost in translation We go off of what we believe the situation is rather than what it truly is I don t think I m more righteous than you I wish I could do more for you I wish I could help you and make you happier I wish I could be someone you could rely on more I m sorry I couldn t give you that comfort I m sorry I ve turned you away so many times I m sorry for all the times that I ve been ungrateful I m sorry for being so rude to you and being so mean to you mama I m sorry for not appreciating you more or making you feel like you weren t good enough I m sorry for not giving you a shoulder to cry on or giving you the comfort you needed I m sorry that I wasn t able to hold you when you needed it I m sorry for hurting your feelings intentionally and all the many times I did it unintentionally You deserved a tender heart from me but I was blind a lot of times to my words or to how you felt I was blinded by my own pain and anger I m sorry for any time I ve lied to you any time that I ve made you feel unhappy any time that I made you feel like I was looking down on you I m sorry for anything I ve done to come against you or hurt you I m so sorry from the bottom of my heart I m sorry mama I want you to be happy I wish I could have been a lot better in the times where I wasn t good enough I want nothing but the best for you I wish that I could take all of your pain away and I wish that I could press a button and have all of our issues wiped away I wish our family could go back to normal In this letter I may say some things that you don t agree with but please for me please just read what I have to say Please I know things in our lives have taken a turn for the worse and it s like a rollercoaster continuing to push forward in the wrong direction Our family fell apart so quickly that it was hard to stop it In reality when I think about it it s all in slow motion The slow grinding down of every one I know that our family has struggled with many things and I know that it s hard to pinpoint it all I come to you earnestly mom I just want you to be honest with me I just want you to give me some closure and something real I need that from you Mom Please Please allow me this I know I know about a lot of things I know and I don t know I know there are things that I ll never know You need to be honest with yourself I know I m not trying to judge you Mom I m not trying to hurt you I just want my mama back so badly I know you think it s fine and I know you think things aren t caused by what you re doing But they have been for a long time This letter isn t about Dad but I know he s done more than his fair share of it too It s not that I m just blaming you mama but you don t understand what I feel for you I don t feel the same things with Dad I know it feels like I always let him off the hook or am being nicer to him but it s because I don t expect him to do anything else I expect so much from you because I know what you re capable of I don t understand it myself I don t know why it s so much easier to talk to Dad or why it feels like I can forgive him so easily when I know deep down he s nothing compared to you Don t get me wrong I love Dad to pieces but you You were my mom and my dad for so much of my life You were always there for me and raised me in the most loving gentle and warmest way possible You did it perfectly mama I m so proud of you You held me when I cried you rubbed my feet when they hurt and you kissed my knees when I fell You stayed with me You loved me you nursed me back to health when I was sick you made me laugh when I was sad you played games with me when I was bored How could anyone be a better mother than you You re my person It s so much harder for me to forgive you It s so much harder for me to speak to you freely It s so hard for me because I just want to express to you how much I love you but I can t help but hold things against you I can t help but be mad at you I m sorry about that Something different about him he ll be honest with me even if it s just a little He ll apologize because he knows he s an addict An alcoholic You re so much more than these drugs mama Then those people who are claiming to have your back Dad is more than the alcohol and addiction too But you re something special mama You re so special You re like diamonds and gold how can anyone be better than you You re more than all of this You re my world I can t help but hold everything against you because I want my mommy so badly I want the mother who had that soft heart I want the mother who wasn t weighed down by the world I want you I want you back I know that these drugs talk for you a lot of the time I know it feels like you re in a car with no breaks I know things are happening so naturally around you that it s hard to think that these drugs are the issue I know that mama I don t blame you for being addicted I don t blame you for hustling I don t blame you for living the life that you feel was dealt to you I don t blame you for those things and I don t hold them against you I don t think you re a bad person I don t think you re disgusting I don t think you re worthless I don t think that you re unsavable You re more than any drug in this world any lifestyle in this world I don t blame you for those things I blame you for not facing those facts though I blame you for not being honest with yourself and with me I blame you for not having the dignity to realize that you re not hiding the truth from anyone You hurt others more by simply pretending you aren t doing what you are If you aren t ashamed to do it in secret you shouldn t be ashamed to do it openly I know It s not hard to tell I can tell when you re high I can tell when you re sober I can t tell every time you lie but I know you do Please just be honest with me Please show me that Please mama I have suffered a lot in my childhood but I know many people have I have gone through a lot of pain in my life but I know many people have I know that things and life aren t always normal I wish you could be honest with me If you would give me that it would be so much easier for me to forgive you and have us move on We don t have to live like this forever Our family doesn t have to suffer forever It starts with being honest You need help There s nothing wrong with that I just want things to change and move on from this I want to grow our lives and be together again I want to come over to the house and feel welcomed again I want to see you and feel loved again I want to hold you and feel like a kid again I want to show you my heart and not feel scared that you ll get high again I want you to leave the drugs behind I want you to be able to start a new life that you can actually be happy in I want you back I want these drugs to die and go to hell I know that when I moved out you had a lot of thoughts about it I know you thought someone was influencing me The truth of that is Mom I m hardly swayed by others Every time I confront you or try to talk to you about things that have happened you always act like its other people who tell me what to say but that s simply not true I have never been moved to say something I don t believe I have never been moved to hate you People don t talk about you as much as you think they do When I would come over here to Nana s house before I moved out none of us would speak on you or whatever situation was going on We moved out to get away from all of that I have always driven my own ship I have always formed my own opinions Nothing I have ever said to you was brought out by someone else Justin never talks badly of you in fact he only talks about how much he loves you and wishes you would get the help you need Same for Nana We defend you more than most people do It s not fair for you to blame us in that way When everything happened after the 4th of July it wasn t anyone else s choice but my own to leave I had warned you for months that I was going to move out if you and Dad didn t change but nothing happened You didn t believe me I told you in December that things needed to change or I wasn t staying The months went on I tried to bring it up but nothing ever happened when I did January nothing February nothing March nothing April nothing May nothing June nothing I couldn t take it anymore Both you and Dad refused to get the help you needed The help I begged you to get I want you to be happy Mom I want you and Dad to change for the better I m sick of this life we seem to be stuck to The last two years of our lives have felt like honestly hell Alcohol drugs anger violence manipulation and more have infested the structure of our family I wanted change I needed it I begged for it I tried to talk to you about it I tried to warn you about it but you would turn me away and get mad You told me that I wasn t going to move out I realized you told me that you wanted the same change as me just so I d shut up You guys didn t even falter when I told you I would leave You were shocked when I actually did and blamed everyone but yourselves You and dad You had six months Do you think I wanted to move out mom Do you think as a 17 year old that I wanted to pay my own bills To burden the people around me to take me back and forth to work and school To make all of my choices by myself Do you think I wanted to be away from my home and my family I was a child I forced myself to grow up and get somewhere that didn t feel like a house of darkness and depression I ve done so much myself and I deserve some credit for that I don t deserve you blaming me for leaving I don t deserve you treating me like some spoiled brat I don t deserve you treating me like I think I m better than you because I want more for myself I didn t deserve how much you guys put on me I m your daughter not your emotional scapegoat I m not the one that s supposed to bring happiness to the house and carry the burden of everyone s depression either I don t deserve you belittling me I handle EVERYTHING on my own I do EVERYTHING on my own I tried my hardest to keep our relationship after I moved out I m the one who came to see y all I m the one who called and texted y all I m the one who forgave y all You guys wouldn t let it go you guys wouldn t treat me equally you guys made me feel like an outsider That wasn t fair to me For the first month after moving out it felt like I was mourning my family It felt like I was mourning you I cried and cried and cried I laid in bed and sobbed myself to sleep every night because I didn t have my mom I want you back mom I don t want the drugs I ve forgiven you time and time again the least you could give me is a little respect and honesty If you want to be honest with me I ll always listen I ll never judge what you ve done If you lie to me again I ll continue to push you away Trust is earned in droplets and lost by buckets You have lost my trust I love you If you want to get in contact with me after you ve read this entire letter reach out through someone to let me know If not we ll continue no contact I love you mama I love you so so so so so much

I have been using meth for about 3 years. I work a full time job and still have a job thankfully. I rent my home and have three amazing dogs that I love dearly.

I know in the long run it will get me in trouble and I will or possibly can lose everything. I last used this evening and I am already just disgusted about it and about myself. I don't usually go out like I use to when I was younger but I don't think my addiction is the cause of wanting to be home a lot..who knows..but  does it really get better getting sober? I am literally wanting to just break my pipe and be done with it. I do notice though I am constantly thinking a lot, worrying a lot about stupid shit, and just the feeling of scared all the time. I know I am not 100% myself, but when I am high I don't care about anything just the great feeling it gives me the energy and everything. Tonight I am really considering just breaking my pipe and being done with it for good. I wanna be happy and I feel happy whenever I use but once I am about low and done I get sad cause I need to reup again....I don't know I am all over the place with this...please tell me the honest truth....or i'm I just thinking wrong that being sober is boring.

reddit,1joj5zr,addiction,2025-04-01 06:21:38,Advice Needed on Being a Supportive Partner to Someone with Addiction,"Hi, my (21F) partner (22M) just opened up to me about his struggle with substance abuse and overall dependency on marijuana, nicotine and pornography. He decided, on his own accord last week, to quit it all and is now going through withdrawal symptoms. But overall, he is seeking help from his family, actively finding a therapist and has opened up to everyone close to him in his life (his friends, his family and me). We did talk recently, and he confessed to me that he has been using nicotine and marijuana daily and has consumed pornography regularly as well. I was very proud of him for opening up and telling me the truth. I know it took a lot of courage to do so, and I reassured him I will be there to support his recovery every step of the way. We even made a plan where he will give me weekly check-ins on his feelings and any general urges he has.

My main problem is that I feel incredibly hurt still, and I feel major guilt for even feeling this way. We had talks in the past (maybe a little over a year ago?) where he told me he quit nicotine, and another where I mentioned his pornography use has influenced the way I perceive myself and my overall confidence in our relationship. Anyways, he did not quit when we initially talked about it. It hurts because it feels like this past year has been a lie. I can't help but think of all the times he would seem spaced out or high, and I just never noticed or passed it off as him being tired.  I may have also dropped the ball at times. I was too afraid to ask him, out of fear he would think I don't trust him. I don't know, I feel like I'm a bit out of my depth here. I want to help him, but I really don't know how without sorting through my emotions first, and I just don't know who to reach out to. I don't know anyone in my life who can help.

At the end of the day, I know his substance issues are a symptom of a much bigger problem; he is aware of this as well, which is why he is going to therapy asap. But I feel like for me to be the best supporting partner I could be, I need to address my own feelings about how his addiction has hurt me.

I got my partying down to the weekend but outside of the weekend I can't move if I don't use. DOC being K, C, and alcohol. 

I have friends and people who actively invite me to things but it never feels like enough. I always feel guilty and ashamed about the friendships I lost from my active addiction and mental health issues. I am on Welbrution but I still feel incredibly dull. There were moments when that wasn't true

I recently been laid off and need to get up and apply to jobs but I just can't do anything. I lay down in bed all day. I have plans for dinner with a friend and I want to cancel so badly. I feel like I have nothing to live for. 

I usually pull myself up no matter what but lately it isn't happening. 

I feel like now isn't the time to cut off my usage but I feel incredibly guilty when I do use. 

+ does the energy eventually rebound? 

+ should I use now and wait to til I get through this unemployment to address the addiction? 

+ I also have a scheduled treatment coming up. Should I wait until I start the treatment? 

I've been on and off for a while and could be sober for months at a time. I'm at a point now where I need a bump of coke to get out the house.

reddit,1joev6u,addiction,2025-04-01 03:05:02,The Inner Secret,"There's something you don't want to look at.

Something ugly and uncomfortable that you aren't proud of.

Maybe it's the way your relationship is going. Maybe it's drinking a bit too much. Maybe it's the hours you spend browsing YouTube and playing mobile games that just leave you feeling empty and like you've wasted your vitality afterward. Maybe it's that p\*\*n habit that's still not under control.

Regardless of what it is, it's normal for your brain to feel resistance towards taking a deeper look at these uncomfortable, yucky situations you may be facing.

But where most guys go wrong is they let that resistance stop them.

And interestingly, that pretty much guarantees that the yucky, uncomfortable bullshit will perpetually be a plague for them. Nothing significantly changing, certainly not for the better, often for years on end...

On the other hand, I've seen a certain type of guy.

They're the kinds of guys I love to work with 1-on-1, and they're also the kinds of guys who are actually my friends in the real world too. Guys who are willing to take a good look at themselves and work on any aspect of themselves that needs some attention, regardless of the discomfort it may make them feel.

Because they know a secret:

That if they feel a lot of resistance towards something *that they objectively know would be good for them,* then that's exactly where they should be looking, and they lean into that resistance.

Making themselves take a closer look, even if it hurts.

So I invite you to adopt that kind of mentality.

If there's something you've been avoiding because it feels yucky and uncomfortable and you wish it wasn't the way it is... well, the way to change it is to own it and face it.

""If I ignore it for long enough it'll go away..."" is a loser's mentality that just flat out isn't true, especially in the case of relationship disharmony and addictive tendencies.

What a lot of guys don't realize, either, is that their p\*\*n habit is sneakily connected to every one of the other most common things guys struggle with.

Let me explain.

Many men struggle to stay consistent in their disciplines - and if their brain's dopamine reward center is burned out from pornography, that's not surprising, because consistency relies on a healthy dopamine reward center that's functioning as it should.

Many men struggle with connection in their relationships - and p\*\*n trains them to satisfy their own needs without a real partner being involved, undercutting their partners and their potential partners with a pixel-harem that'll do anything they want at the tap of a finger.

Many men struggle with anxiety - and p\*\*n is something that fundamentally fractures their self-esteem and confidence, causing that anxiety to spike after they indulge.

Many men struggle with spending way too much time on technology - and that's a form of escapism that's reinforced by using p\*\*n, too. If your brain's reward center is desensitized to the normal pleasures of life, because it's used to the ""super-high"" stimulation of p\*\*n, it basically won't want to engage with those ""normal"" aspects of your lifestyle as much, preferring the screen or the booze or the whatever that give it quick, easy dopamine and escapism.

Which is why quitting p\*\*n is one of the cornerstone steps in the modern man's self-improvement journey.

Because leaving that self-destructive habit in place negatively influences all the other areas that are worth giving a shyt about.

And removing it, conversely, helps uplift those areas.",The Inner Secret There s something you don t want to look at Something ugly and uncomfortable that you aren t proud of Maybe it s the way your relationship is going Maybe it s drinking a bit too much Maybe it s the hours you spend browsing YouTube and playing mobile games that just leave you feeling empty and like you ve wasted your vitality afterward Maybe it s that p n habit that s still not under control Regardless of what it is it s normal for your brain to feel resistance towards taking a deeper look at these uncomfortable yucky situations you may be facing But where most guys go wrong is they let that resistance stop them And interestingly that pretty much guarantees that the yucky uncomfortable bullshit will perpetually be a plague for them Nothing significantly changing certainly not for the better often for years on end On the other hand I ve seen a certain type of guy They re the kinds of guys I love to work with 1 on 1 and they re also the kinds of guys who are actually my friends in the real world too Guys who are willing to take a good look at themselves and work on any aspect of themselves that needs some attention regardless of the discomfort it may make them feel Because they know a secret That if they feel a lot of resistance towards something that they objectively know would be good for them then that s exactly where they should be looking and they lean into that resistance Making themselves take a closer look even if it hurts So I invite you to adopt that kind of mentality If there s something you ve been avoiding because it feels yucky and uncomfortable and you wish it wasn t the way it is well the way to change it is to own it and face it If I ignore it for long enough it ll go away is a loser s mentality that just flat out isn t true especially in the case of relationship disharmony and addictive tendencies What a lot of guys don t realize either is that their p n habit is sneakily connected to every one of the other most common things guys struggle with Let me explain Many men struggle to stay consistent in their disciplines and if their brain s dopamine reward center is burned out from pornography that s not surprising because consistency relies on a healthy dopamine reward center that s functioning as it should Many men struggle with connection in their relationships and p n trains them to satisfy their own needs without a real partner being involved undercutting their partners and their potential partners with a pixel harem that ll do anything they want at the tap of a finger Many men struggle with anxiety and p n is something that fundamentally fractures their self esteem and confidence causing that anxiety to spike after they indulge Many men struggle with spending way too much time on technology and that s a form of escapism that s reinforced by using p n too If your brain s reward center is desensitized to the normal pleasures of life because it s used to the super high stimulation of p n it basically won t want to engage with those normal aspects of your lifestyle as much preferring the screen or the booze or the whatever that give it quick easy dopamine and escapism Which is why quitting p n is one of the cornerstone steps in the modern man s self improvement journey Because leaving that self destructive habit in place negatively influences all the other areas that are worth giving a shyt about And removing it conversely helps uplift those areas,0,1,"to feel resistance towards taking a deeper look at these uncomfortable, yucky situations you may be facing",Purple_Novel_7814,https://reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1joev6u/the_inner_secret/,0.9873,0.11003105590062112,Moderate,Positive
reddit,1joenza,addiction,2025-04-01 02:56:42,Xanax Addiction,"I hate this stuff so much. I had been on benzos on and off for 20 years, mainly Klonopin which was much easier to titrate off of.

I was on Klonopin but got switched to Xanax over a year ago back when Klonopin manufactures were all on back orders. So my Dr switched me to Xanax 2mg 3x a day the same dose of Klonopin I was prescribed except I was only actually taking the Klonopin 2mg 2x a day. 

I just want to get off of this stuff so bad. I beat a heroin addiction that I had but this stuff to me is harder to kick than heroin. 

I have a refill on my Xanax next week and appointment next month. I’ve been contemplating scheduling my appointment earlier before my refill to get it switched over to Klonopin again so I can start lowering my dose. In my experience Klonopin was always much easier to taper off of but this Xanax doesn’t last long at all. I take it and read about all the negative stuff and a few hours laster take another 2mg pill to where it’s up to 6-8mg a day now.

I am scared because I don’t have resources for rehab, I have a job, a life and everything is great but this medication is ruining everything. I want to schedule my appointment this week before my upcoming refill to ask my Dr to cancel it to switch it back to Klonopin instead of Xanax because I don’t want to do another month of this and wait til my 3 month follow up with him.

I get weird anxiety that in make it early right before my refill he is gonna cut me off which I know is illogical and just my anxiety because cutting some off of 6mg of Xanax a day is life threatening. I don’t know if I should go in this week show him I’m still taking them and have the remaining pills I should until my refill and so him to cancel it and switch it with Klonopin or just try and cope with it another month and go to my regular 3 month follow up.

My rebound anxiety in the morning is so bad sometimes I have to call off work. I had to call off today or sometimes I’ll set my alarms for 6:45am to take my meds, then have my second one set for 7:30 so when I wake up I don’t feel so awful. 

I don’t know what to do, benzos should not be detoxed in an inpatient setting because it’s a long monthly process

My anxiety is so bad, that one bag had me thinking i was about to die. I never wanted to OD and thankfully never did before. In that moment i decided im not doing any other bags until he comes outta jail. I stuck with my methadone for 2 days and craving a bag. Was cleaning my box so i could find straws to scrape and I find one brand new bag. Felt like i found $1000. I told myself this was it, watever craving i had this would have to fulfill it.

reddit,1jobixg,addiction,2025-04-01 00:48:23,Just some thoughts from my past journey and things I wish somebody told me.,"I'm not sure how to start this, but it's something I am grateful I finally found out when I hit rock bottom.

I have been you. You've tried everything you can think of and you've failed. Night and day you fight with the demons inside you. You wrestle with your own brain and you wish you could win. But how can you outsmart yourself? How can you overpower your own brain? It knows what your plan is, where you're going, when you're tired and weak and unable to fight. And no matter how long you make it, how long you are good for, how long you fight—it's never enough. Eventually, you will fail. And they will be right. You can't beat it, and you are a failure for it.

Well, I'm here to tell you—they're right. Tada! Turns out we are failures, and we can't get it right, and we will never be able to fix it. We suck at fixing it. And honestly, the feeling to give up trying isn't 100% wrong. But it is like 5% wrong.

What it's missing is the fact that there *is* a way out. The little 5% gap where it is possible to change.

Now the problem? That 5% is in different places for each person. But I can tell you where it's *not* at. That's pretty much the same for everyone:

- It's not in praying harder.
- It's not in hoping harder.
- It's not in sheer willpower or strength.
- It's not in distance from the problem.
- It's not in new patterns of self-destruction.
- And it's definitely not accepting your fate as an addict.

I've tried all of those—repeatedly, in different ways and flavors and combinations. They all lead to the same feelings of shame and fear and hurt and hopelessness and depression and anxiety and sadness and hate.

Now, while that escape from addiction is going to be different for every person in every process, the fundamental power behind it will always be the same:

You have to quit lying.

- Lying to yourself about being able to fix it.
- Lying to others about how bad it is.
- Lying about where you are and what you're doing.
- Lying about the effects it has on you and the things you care about.

The worst shame of it all is being caught in these lies.

I promise you—*the lies about it hurt worse than the addiction itself.*

---

Now, I can't tell you where your path leads. I don't know your specific issues and circumstances. But I do know how I got out, and the general things that allowed me to do so.

I hit rock bottom one day, and at 4 in the morning in a stranger's bathroom, I sent a text out to everybody that I had been lying to about my issue—my now ex, my religious leader, and my therapist.

I then spent the next month telling everybody that was connected to me and my addiction—my parents, siblings, friends, roommates—everybody I could think of that I had lied to. And let me tell you, that was the beginning of the end.

So far, I've been in an addiction recovery program for over a year. I have a stretch of sobriety, but honestly, that part doesn't even matter to me anymore. Sobriety days are just a number.

Don't get me wrong, I find sobriety to be very important in my life, but it's not what I was working toward. I was working toward breaking free of the addiction. And I have. I am not tied down to the shame and the lies. I have nowhere left to hide—and I love it. And it all came from leaving behind the lies.

Now, I highly recommend therapy. I think it's the best way to go about reconstructing your life. But you have to go in willing to be broken down, ripped apart, rearranged, and then rebuilt.

And if you can, join a support group. Find a group where you all have experienced somewhat of the same background and share. You’ll all find that even if it's not the exact same experience, you can understand where the problems are coming from—and why you're each struggling with them.

But if that's not for you, then find *somebody*. Just one person.

Someone you can tell *everything* to. Every excruciating detail. Every terrible thing you've done. Every hole you've found yourself in.

You have to get it out of you. You have to quit giving it the power to control you from the shadows.

So go get it done. You can't fix it, but you sure as hell can find somebody who can help you. Quit hiding, quit running, quit trying to lone-wolf it. Let yourself get ripped apart and fixed, and then you can go about your life how you wish it was.

reddit,1jo5pki,addiction,2025-03-31 20:50:28,"I realized, through my Dharma Recovery meeting, that the pinnacle of my addiction issues is I’m addicted to external validation.","So, I’m someone who has bipolar and extreme PTSD. Like, there’s a reason why I’m 22 and I’m 100% completely estranged from the entirety of my family levels of extreme PTSD. 

I went to a Dharma Recovery meeting for the first time yesterday and then yoga through The Phoenix afterwards. I learned so much about myself and it’s been the most helpful recovery group I’ve ever been to (and I’ve tried them all—AA, NA, SMART Recovery, etc). If trauma is a main trigger for addiction issues, I really highly recommend Dharma Recovery. Anyways, because I stopped overthinking through the meditation practices and just let the thoughts flow through my head naturally, I realized a few things. First of all, while I went back to recovery groups for my DOC of cannabis and to make sure I stay off of the alcohol and meth I used to abuse, the core of my addiction is external validation. Why? As I put it in my meeting yesterday, in my childhood as a 3 year old, if I didn’t notice the slightest twitch of one of my parent’s eyes to see how they were doing, I had to worry if I was going to be alive in the next 5 minutes. So, I theorize I developed an addiction to external validation because it was the thing that kept me safe at that time. Second, after I realized this, I realized that I do not need external validation anymore to feel safe since, 95% of the time, I’m safe now because my family will never see me or hurt me again. My new mantra is “you don’t need external validation to be safe” and it’s so helpful. Third, when I did yoga afterwards, I told myself that I’m safe enough to let go of the physical tension in my body. A headache released in my head and I realized that I’ve had a headache 24/7 and didn’t realize it because it was just normal to me. 

In my last 11 days of sobriety, I’ve learned one very important thing. To be sober, you need to be 100% honest, stop escaping your reality, and accept it no matter how painful it is if you want to be sober. And, I realized that because external validation is truly the core of my addiction, I examined some of the friendships I had started re-introducing into my life. Then it hit me. I constantly feel extreme emotional pain 24/7 because, with how nuanced my life has been truly, people are just unable to understand my life. And, because I’ve been so traumatized to the point where trauma infects every conversation I have (minus small talk), I try to talk about things that are personally important to me (say, my struggles with bipolar or if people ask me how I discovered I was transgender) and I get invalidated every time. Because the core of my addiction is external validation, I feel so extremely hurt in every personal relationship I’ve ever had and the dynamic becomes extremely co-dependent every time. I also figured out why I keep attracting terrible people into my life. They must see that I was craving external validation. Point is, I realized that because of this addiction, having close, personal friendships are a very bad idea for me and I just want to be alone in that regard. Humans need social interaction, so I will socialize at my Dharma Recovery meetings, events my local AA club has, different clubs at my university, etc. However, I’m done talking to those people outside of when I go to engage in those communities (like, I’m not texting people outside of when I see them at a Dharma Recovery meeting for example). So, I explained this to the connections I had been reintroducing in my life. All of them got either pretty sad or angry, but I don’t care. It protects me and honestly, it protects them too. 

It was very difficult to accept at first, I won’t even lie. But, now that I’ve accepted it, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulder. I’m actually thinking things through more logically. I’m much more confident in a healthy way in the world. Before, it felt impossible to prioritize my needs (even eating). Now, I have zero issues eating. It sucks I’ll never have an emergency contact, but as an introvert, I’m very happy to engage in my communities when I need my human need of socialization and then just be by myself at home playing video games or watching funny videos on YouTube. I’m actually 100% comfortable being alone I found out. My two favorite things in the world right now is playing poker on my phone and doing yoga. I just had an addiction to external validation that was confusing me. 

I start intensive therapy for addiction recovery tomorrow that is 30 hours a week. Afterwards, I’m just going to go to meetings and do homework where I can (I took a leave of absence from work despite not being able to afford it at all because I need to focus on recovery and my professors know that I’m not really working on their courses till mid-May). I’m actually happy I realized this before I started intensive therapy so I don’t try to latch onto anyone who’s struggling a lot like me when I go tomorrow.

so traumatized to the point where trauma infects every conversation I have minus small talk I try to talk about things that are personally important to me say my struggles with bipolar or if people ask me how I discovered I was transgender and I get invalidated every time Because the core of my addiction is external validation I feel so extremely hurt in every personal relationship I ve ever had and the dynamic becomes extremely co dependent every time I also figured out why I keep attracting terrible people into my life They must see that I was craving external validation Point is I realized that because of this addiction having close personal friendships are a very bad idea for me and I just want to be alone in that regard Humans need social interaction so I will socialize at my Dharma Recovery meetings events my local AA club has different clubs at my university etc However I m done talking to those people outside of when I go to engage in those communities like I m not texting people outside of when I see them at a Dharma Recovery meeting for example So I explained this to the connections I had been reintroducing in my life All of them got either pretty sad or angry but I don t care It protects me and honestly it protects them too It was very difficult to accept at first I won t even lie But now that I ve accepted it I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulder I m actually thinking things through more logically I m much more confident in a healthy way in the world Before it felt impossible to prioritize my needs even eating Now I have zero issues eating It sucks I ll never have an emergency contact but as an introvert I m very happy to engage in my communities when I need my human need of socialization and then just be by myself at home playing video games or watching funny videos on YouTube I m actually 100 comfortable being alone I found out My two favorite things in the world right now is playing poker on my phone and doing yoga I just had an addiction to external validation that was confusing me I start intensive therapy for addiction recovery tomorrow that is 30 hours a week Afterwards I m just going to go to meetings and do homework where I can I took a leave of absence from work despite not being able to afford it at all because I need to focus on recovery and my professors know that I m not really working on their

Scared to scare them, worried they'll be angry or upset, don't know what to do","I'm 20 so I'm over 18 and have the right to medical privacy. Thankfully no one contacted my family last night, that would've terrified them. I collapsed after doing quite a lot of (untested) ket and smoking weed. I'm a daily benzo addict and a poly addict (every day I use something that gets me high because the benzos don't but often swap between stuff. I've only done ketamine a few times before). I was talking to someone in my temporary accommodation at the time where I'm living because I'm homeless due to addiction, social services told my parents they had to kick me out after my addiction came out to them when I had a suicide attempt on illicit substances in my bedroom at my parents house. 

My family haven't been bad with my addiction or anything but they worry a lot. I've scared them and I hate that, I hate worrying them. But I also try to be honest with them because they want me to be. So far I've only told a friend and sent my key worker at the addiction service a message saying what happened. 

Last night an ambulance was called. Initially I collapsed and I'm not sure if I went unconscious. Then my breathing got harder, I felt like all my chest and esophagus was tight and I couldn't breathe properly. I was twitchy and tense and I remember having spasms. All my muscles are sore today. The paramedic was squeezing my collarbone hard at one point and I wasn't even responding to or feeling the pain, he checked after that he hadn't broken it because he said he was squeezing it hard. I haven't seen the notes so I don't know everything and I wasn't properly conscious for a lot of it so I remember the basics but not much. I know they said they gave me narcan twice (nasal and then IV) but didn't suspect opiates because it didn't do much. Apparently I had respiratory arrest. I remember having oxygen and something about co2 at some point? Something on my neck too. And an IV with stuff put in it. That's pretty much all I can remember. 

I discharged myself against medical advice last night at hospital. They did vitals and an ECG and took blood but I wanted to go before they got the results, I just wanted to go to bed and hospitals are a trigger so I needed to leave. They let me sign a form to go after assessing my capacity and making sure I knew the risks (respiratory depression, etc.). 

I feel like crap today. Nauseous, weak, tired, sore, dizzy, I just feel like crap which is probably to be expected. I still don't know what went wrong anyway, if there was something else in the ket or I ODed but I didn't think you could easily OD on ket? But apparently I looked and was bad. I felt bad, I thought I was gonna die. I felt like I was dying, my whole body was prickly and tingly and then everything felt muffled and I thought I was gonna go. 

But yeah I'm alive. And I don't know whether to tell my family anything. I haven't even told my best mate in case I scare him or he feels responsible because we did the same K together the night before though it was mine and I bought it and it was different then because I was careful and it was fun. Last night I was in a bad headspace trying to make it go away so I just used and used and kept snorting more.

I feel like I need to live anonymously, no identifiable social media, live in a different state, all new contacts and yet… I still feel like for the rest of his natural life, I am going to forever be looking over my shoulder and questioning where I go, etc.

I (27f ) deal with depression and health anxiety, but the anxiety has gotten significantly worse since I graduated college and since I experience Hurricane Helene. I have always had health anxiety in and off, but for the last few months it has gotten significantly worse. I went to the ER three times a few weeks ago because I was convinced something was wrong with me and was having near constant panic attacks and not sleeping. They got me on meds that have done a good job stabilizing me - I am now in a partial hospitalization program. 
I have had a theory for several years now that my experience with appendicitis when I was three years old has caused much of my health anxiety. I was too young to really articulate my pain and doctors had a hard time figuring out what was wrong, so my appendix ruptured and had to be removed. So, I discussed this with my new psychiatrist who told me I meet criteria for PTSD. It makes a lot of sense - I get extremely triggered by hospital shows and other depictions of diseases and bodily harm, and I am in a constant state of hyper vigilance where any bodily sensation that feels off, even benign, can cause me to panic. He asked me if I had had any related nightmares and I said no, not really. 
This is the weird bit - I was extremely dis regulated after that talk, and I tried to go home and take a nap which is an old coping mechanism. I then had a nightmare about slowly hallucinating, dying, and calling for help. Is this normal? It’s like it was an immediate response to the question my psychiatrist asked, or a confirmation that I do indeed have ptsd. I’m so afraid of things getting worse now that I have that confirmation.

reddit,1jpwnvy,ptsd,2025-04-03 00:27:12,The fear that everyone hates me and is judging me,"I always feel embarrassed and like I’m doing something wrong. Whether I am or I’m not. I felt this way since my trauma’s. Before the traumas I was quite chill. I wasn’t really that embarrassed often. But now it’s almost chronic. 

I’ve been embarrassed a lot. I got raped a few times which really in itself feels embarrassing. But the first time and last time was the worst.

The first times my rapist knew I was going through the “I’m a big girl” phase. So would constantly say “this is something big girls do.” “You’re a big girl right?” “You’re acting like a baby.” “It’s just a game big girls play.” 

Whenever I’d not like it or try to resist it. And I’d feel embarrassed that I wasn’t being a big girl. I mean I wasn’t but I wanted to be. 

And my most recent got filmed and posted online and sent to people I know which is humiliating.

I also would get bullied and humiliated constantly for years. Even physically.

Now everything I say is wrong. I’m embarrassed. If someone doesn’t reply to my texts or doesn’t respond in a way I like. Or I just get self conscious. I feel awful. When I’m embarrassed whether it’s over a valid reason or not it gets so bad I feel suicidal. Right now I’m embarrassed for a valid reason.

I got arrested. Told my friends about it and obviously they felt awkward about that. Now I’m just humiliated.

I had to tell them because I might not be allowed back in college and I wanted them to be aware now rather than later when it’s all been decided. And then they’ll wonder why I didn’t mention it.

But still obviously I’m embarrassed.

And scared they’ll leave me. Which I guess is fair. But I HATE people leaving me. It feels physically painful to be rejected. 

Another thing that really hurts.

Also today was honest with one of those friends who told me that this group of people who she doesn’t really know have started being OVERLY nice to her. Like literally calling her their best friend and stuff that and that she’s adorable and really sweet and they love her and want to marry her.

And I said “I’d be carful. Obviously don’t assume everyone has bad intentions but if they’re all doing this in a short space of time and don’t know you that could be them making fun of you. Like obviously assess it yourself but that’s a red flag.” 

Which was my way of looking out for her and I was genuinely concerned and she seemed to be greatful I told her this because she had also been considering this but now I feel awful because she might feel like I mean it as a diss about her and her not being lovable. And now I’m scared she won’t talk to me anymore because I’m so negative. 

I just want to die to be honest.

For those of you who have not met me, I am a clinical hypnotherapist; much of my work sees me working with trauma in many forms; there is a common thing that exists amongst those living with PTSD: nightmares.

I myself had terrible nightmares for years. My own work with my hypnotherapist saw them fade, but a few years ago, something amazing went public. Some researchers in Europe discovered something groundbreaking... A piano chord that could help reduce the instances and severity of nightmares. I will include their research below.

Now, it should be noted that this was made to be used in conjunction with other therapies, but my clients have reported significant results even without supportive care. I have a version of this file that I sell, you see. However, today I'd like to give you all something. My file. My iteration of that amazing research that was done, proven effective and, in my opinion, invaluable. You may find it below, under the research.

How to use: this recording is designed to be started when you lie down to sleep. For the first 90 minutes, there is silence. The reason for this is to give your brain time to settle into Delta, the sleep state. That's all, simply let it play.

I was in therapy for a couple months after and thought I was doing better,  but triggers are coming back.

This all happend in alaska.  The roads are horribly icy in the winter and it's dark all the time.  The sun is back now and the roads have been dry for a month until yesterday.  Now there is a snow storm in and the roads are slick as hell.

I was going to work and I had a car tailgating me so bad I couldn't even see their headlights over the tailgate of my truck for several miles.  I tried slowing down and I tried honking but they kept doing it.  

I'm not proud oh the next part, but the road became a 2 lane at a stop light and I rolled down my window and yelled at the them that if they wanted to die on the road to find someone else to crash into.  They yelled something obscene back and started fishing in their console for what I assume was a gun.  The light changed and I took off on a side road.

I know how stupid and dangerous road rage is and I regret my actions.  I just don't know how to stay calm when people are driving dangerously anymore.  This was never me before.

reddit,1joqqru,ptsd,2025-04-01 14:04:41,Should i start heal my trauma with EMDR ? Stuck in survival mode,"Hello, everything is on the title. I want to start EMDR to heal from my humiliation, reject who are my 2 biggest wounds from teenager period (and also abandonment reject) but i have serious interrogations about the method and my personal situation. I beg you to read my story please because i'm seeking some advice and help here. It's separated in **3 points** (story, main problem and my ideas). My main interrogations comes at the end. 

# My story :

I lost my father right before my 10th years old. I was then bullied at school from my 11th years old to my 15th years old. It wasn't physical harassment or very violent stuff everyday. But it was more subtle like little mockeries from my classmates towards me almost everyday or even sometimes intimidation but always this feeling of being the one person that needs to be mocked. Out of an entire week of school, there was maybe 1 or 2 days without harassment. I also suffered from harassment from my 16th to 18th years old at the school dormitory/residence. This time it was more serious harassment, especially the first year there with intimidation and hazing. It was almost every night and i remember myself trying to hide to not be noticed by the people who were doing this. Then the second year, they almost stopped and we had more normal conversations but i was still trying to hide from them in case of they would restart. 

Also during all of those school years, i also felt that I was the last of the group every time, the one a little behind the group and who imposed his presence in a group that didn't want me. This feeling was particularly marked after the age of 15.

# My main problem now :

Today because of that, **i've made the conclusion (you can tell me if i'm right or not) that i suffer from humiliation and reject wounds**. I suffer from strong social anxiety and toxic shame. I literally can't start, Starting and maintaining a conversation, and making it interesting. I've completely lost my ability to think and analyze. It's as if my brain was completely blank and I'm somewhere else when someone is talking to me. The person will talk to me, but no thoughts will come to mind. My memory is also blocked, and I absolutely can't access my knowledge or my general culture. I therefore absolutely can't respond to what the person is saying, and it makes me panic internally. As a result, I try to find every way to escape the situation. Because of this impossibility of my brain to process and decode what the people are telling me, I have no friends and i can't connect with anyone, even with my own family. And strangely it's even worse with men than with women.

This ability to think and analyze is also nonexistent outside of social situations. I feel like my brain is permanently blank, in a permanent fog, to the point where I wonder myself if I have any knowledge or culture still stored in my brain. This thing is hard to describe or visualize if you never felt it before but it's my case.  Now i'm 28 years old and i never had any great social relationships since i left school (8/9 years ago), only contacts with my finally. I have taken refuge behind screens for a lot of time since i'm 14 and spend at least 12-13  hours a day in average.

# My conclusions and idea of solution (with questions):

I've heard about tools how to heal those wounds, like of course EMDR but also cognitive restructuring, TRE and mindfulness but i don't from where to start. There are so much tools. I plan to do all of this by myself because i can't afford a therapy with a professionnal. 

Initially i wanted to start with EMDR but i've heard that  in order for this method to be effective in really healing my wounds (who are the core root of my problems), suppressed traumatic memories and souvenirs by my unconscious needs to get back to the surface and then be **analyzed to be definitely processed and integrated in an positive way** this time. And here is the problem, i'm unable to think and analyze anything at the moment because of that Fight Flight Freeze/survival mode. So i'm doing EMDR, i might not be able to process and analyze every traumatic memory and the emotions that comes with them. If i can't analyze them, it might get things worse. I'm not even sure my brain would allow to make those painful souvenirs go back to my conscious mind, because it seems my mind wants to control everything. It's like i'm dissociated. In the same time, i've read on internet that EMDR is the only solution to leave this Fight Flight Freeze mode but it's not logical at all and contradictory.

So i'm lost. What would you do ? Should i still start with EMDR ? Or should i do something else before ? What's your thoughts on the whole situation please ?

TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS SA (IN DETAIL), MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES 

My story started in 2019, when I was overweight/obese at the age of 18. I wanted to look skinny/fit because of all the instagram models and influencers I was following. I envied their slender bodies and slim stomachs. So I started extreme restricting. I would only eat lettuce and some lentils. I would have a fruit smoothie and a bagel. I started dropping pounds. I was obsessed with the scale, I ended up losing 30 pounds by 2020.  I was also at a period in my life where I was very insecure, and I was friends with someone who didn’t have the best interest for me, I was on dating apps looking for validation from random guys because I was desperate and ‘crashing out’ I wasn’t really reflecting or thinking about what I was doing on a day to day basis I would just do things without thinking.

 I matched with a very wealthy guy, whom I was initially going to ignore but my friend influenced me to meet him knowing he doesn’t have the best interest in mind. He seemed very charming at first. He manipulative, attractive, but at the same time very cold and distant/disrespectful (basically a sociopath. He lured me into being intimate with him, it was my first time. My family was going through🧿🧿financial-hardships🧿🧿 at that time, so I felt uncomfortable engaging with a capitalist. However he was still able to get me swept off my feet.

 He would be charming and right after the encounter become cold and distant. I hooked up with him multiple times, until the last time. I was engaging in my super restrictive eating habits and was a bit hungry. He wanted to have an encounter with me. I would ignore him most of the time, but this time I got tricked. He said he would “buy me lunch” but I got tricked into getting SA’ed in his car. He reclined my seat and said ""i have an idea"" he got on top of me and thrusted his penis so hard that it was hard for me to breathe and i choked. I felt violated. I had my hands on his hips he said ""grab my ass"" i did t feel comfortable and a dropped my hands from his hips to the side of the my seat. He ejaculated in my mouth and then said ""{**k"" with a malicious grin on his face and then he's like ""where do you f**k other guys?"" and then i try not to say anything and his like ""hmm?"" and i said ""at their place"" and then he leaves me in the middle of the street. I felt violated and humiliated. He later boasted about it to his friends and made fun of my family’s financial situation and just laughed/chuckled about SA’ing me being from a weaker financial position than him. I felt so disgusting and ill, I felt so ashamed of myself and my family. My chest ached for months, I couldn’t eat at all, I barely ate for days I would just stay in my bed and sob for days after days. I got into more of a shell shock after I figured put my “friend” was involved in this stuff. 

I tried to stay strong and just focus on school and my fitness, I would go on jogs early morning or evenings, and I continued my restrictive eating patterns for years until September 2022. I even started strength training. I had fuck- boy situation involved in my life (which I shouldn’t have engaged in given my prior experience). And I thought i could mentally handle it but I couldn’t by mental health. I was emotionally so fragile and would have anger out bursts, crying spells, mood-swings you name it. 

By 2022 of September I started eating more. I stopped trying in school, I had constant brain fog and memory issues. I would skip class and just eat at random cafe’s/restaurants. I would just go on like a food sail. Where I would go to random restaurants/cafeterias, school evemts just to eat food. I would just sleep in the whole day, and order food for myself from TB and other fast-food restaurants. Every time I got hungry I would be reminded of my SA and would binge to make myself feel like im financially secure and I’m safe. I continued engage with behaviors that weren’t good for me and I was still on dating apps. I started failing classes. I wouldn’t have money to get food so I ended up joining an OF group to get cash to order food(I PAINFULLY regret it now). Everyday was living hell. I ended up gaining over 60 pounds by the end of that year. I was at my heaviest last year weighing about 203 pounds. I was 80-90 pounds up.

In October of 2023, I decided that its time I get some help. I decided to join intensive-outpatient therapy, where I was doing therapy 3 hours a day about 3-4 times a week. I started opening up about my situation and got medication for it. I was able to work through my situation talk to a great nurse practitioner who helped me understand my situation and what I went through. She explained me that sociopaths are dangerous people, and we want to stay away from them for our safety. She walked me through the behaviors and emotions i was going through and I felt much better after the treatment and got several therapeutic tools to help me work through complex emotions. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Bipolar/Borderline personality disorder, depression and binge eating disorder. I also ended up seeing a dietician that time whom i explained my situation to and who also diagnosed me with binge eating disorder. 

In the beginning of 2024, I deleted my social media and started doing grocery shopping with $20 (by asking my parents) on a weekly basis. I started exploring home cooked meals and started meal prep. I saw great change in my eating behavior, I didn’t have much treats as I did before, I didn’t have the best mental health but I just did what i had to do to get through school. I still tried to hustle even though it was hard given my mental state, I didn’t work as hard as i should’ve and I was🧿🧿lazy🧿🧿. I traveled to my home country and engaged in a lot of prayer and spiritual activities and I had many epiphanies and continued to work. I joined a fitness program by September 2024 and have shed some weight from my body and I hope to continue doing so. I’ve now have a much better relationship with food and some exercise as well. My mental health is slowly improving/recovering. I didn’t exercise/meal prep last week, but i hope to resume soon. It was a horrible experience to go through but I still found a way to survive despite going through gut-wrenching times.

reddit,1jo7y3j,ptsd,2025-03-31 22:24:01,Advice How to stop ( recover )sexual shame?,"

So, i have been having intrusive thoughts ( sexual intrusive thoughts ). 
And they only come when i find ppl very pretty. Those are usually annoying bc it makes me doubt if its sexual attraction or not. And i gotten afraid that i have been repressing sexual attraction this whole time and idk how i did. Idk what caused this repression and shame. I went to therapy abt this and they kept telling me that im not experiencing sexual shame, but rather just dont like these thoughts, bc of the fact that there is no cause of it. 

These thoughts are pretty disturbing and comes without a warning. Like i have said before, they usually come when i find someone very pretty or cool.


So for example: i go to pinterest and i see a person that looks really pretty. And i would usually go ‘’ wow, they are so pretty ‘’ and would admire them. When this happens, there would be this weird voice in my head that keeps telling me ‘’ this means you want to smash em ‘’ or ‘’ you Will have the urge to do sexual things with their body and you are gonna like it ‘’. Usually when this happens i would feel more disgusted or uncomfortable ( or Even feel pale ). I would Even ask myself if i really want to do this, but the answer Will always be no. I dont feel any sort of urge to do anything sexual to this person. But after saying that, i would still question cuz ‘’ what if im just lying? ‘’ and Thats why i had these thought? And would question Even more and then the more i get stressed abt it, there would be disturbing sexual images in my head that makes everything worse. And i would Even ask myself if im sexually attracted to them? 
And the answer Will be ‘’ no ‘’ or ‘’ i dont know ‘’. 
And then there Will the a voice in my head again telling me that i am denying my sexual attraction and should be liking it. Or that im repressing something. 


When i went to ask somewhere on reddit ( which i shouldn’t ), someone Even suggested that might be shame. And it could make sense. But why would i be ashamed of it? 
The feeling that i have is mostly dislike. But maybe i am ashamed??
What if i am???? Maybe Thats why!!


So i came here to ask if this is what i am experiencing, and if i am experiencing any sexual attraction to this person???

Yea, my body took that shit from me too, we'll add that to the list along with endometriosis, pcos, PTSD, migraines, anxiety/depression, molested in a church basement (one of my first memories),  verbally/mentally abused, manipulated and raised by a drug addict father, and a mother who clocked tf out mentally because she went from her own childhood decade plus of sexual abuse by her step-dad then finally leaves that mess to only get pregnant and stuck with me into another 20 years of abuse. My little brother got the best version of her though, the mother that actually took care of her son and got him help.

 I questioned these people if my convicted chomo ass uncle was one of my abusers, nooo he likes little boys is what I was told. These mfs have talked to that vile human being since the day he was incarcerated, but ignored my ass. 
Why tf am I still here, wtf is the purpose?
I can't even have a normal relationship, and sometimes physical touch makes my skin crawl. I lack empathy in the way that people who claimed to ""love"" me, let me suffer and judged me, watched over and over as I kept suffering.
 
And a huge fuck you to my father's first daughter who was my very first bully. She finally  got cussed out from me, because I stopped being scared of her ass. She may have lost weight for the second time (because who tf gets gastrict bypass and gains almost all their weight back...) Your attitude will always be over 400lbs to me you ass hole. Her mom said to me , she'll be the skinny sister now, maybe but you and your mama's attitudes are both as ugly as your sagging ass skin is. (1/2 sister, and our own father also made sure one time to state the fact that she is ONLY my half sister because he too knew she was always a loud mouth bitch.) Was going to take that with me to the grave because I don't like feelings hurt, but they always had zero issues hurting mine.

I was a fucking child who yall called a sensitive, vain, hypochondriac drama queen because I did everything to not color outside the lines. 

🖕✌️ Literal rage every single days for the last few weeks. 

Now I gotta keep apologizing to everyone including my fiancee because I keep exploding, because somehow IM ALWAYS THE ASSHOLE even after asking for space when I feel the rage so I can ""deal"" and to try to not explode and that isn't even working because they keep trying to ""help"" . 

I'm ready to pack a bag, and do what my my mother's mom did, pretend the past didn't happen. She's the ultimate narcissistic bitch who hides behind God. Will donate to Swaziland in Africa, while still supporting her chomo son in prison. Oh and that ""saint"" also believed my mother was raped, but not her other daughter because apparently only a step-dad will rape and molest his step daughter but not his biological child. And apparently her own son will rape boys, but not me because I was a girl. Okkkkaaaayyy.

I was diagnosed with PTSD almost a month ago after an ongoing traumatic experience that lasted over a year and a half.  I am in professional help, but I want to know what I can do to save myself and my relationship from those who struggle first hand.

I won’t go into details but essentially witnessed very intense DV that stemmed from cheating in their relationship.

I have been in my own relationship for over a year and he’s perfect. No complaints. But, after my PTSD diagnosis I have not been an easy girl friend. I have had these symptoms since before my diagnosis obviously, but they have heightened since I had the professional confirmation.

I get the symptoms surrounding sleeping the worst, but the ones that affect my relationship, I feel so intensely too.

Very poor self esteem, trust issues, and hyper vigilance. The DV I experienced because of cheating has installed a deep rooted fear of abandonment and constant worry I’m being cheated on. I don’t need to feel that way. 
There was one situation where during our relationship he was in contact with a girl without letting me know they used to talk romantically and she was commenting inside jokes on his posts of us, and even when we first started dating she commented “I helped pick these out hehe” on pics of him. I found out they used to talk romantically through my own studying never because he told me. It messed me up pretty bad. They never flirted directly and there was never any ill intent.

Very petty reasons for me to be upset but it lead me to doing something bad like going through his messages once with out permission. I regret that.
We solved those issues, but I still worry so much about being betrayed and it’s not his fault. I’m also so emotional and so sensitive. I wasn’t always like this. I want to be a better girlfriend but my PTSD has made me so depressed. Our relationship is not worth throwing away for my mental health. I’m in professional help and he’s so patient with me while I get better but I’m not sure what’s wrong with me that’s still making everything so difficult and painful.

TW: mentions of COCSA, parental neglect and general grossness


Hi. I am extremely ashamed about some things I did years ago (around age 11-15 or so) and I just seriously don’t see a way out. I’d appreciate some kind advice

For some context, I may have been SA’d at a very young age by my sister who is almost 4 years older than me, although it wasn’t really that bad and I don’t know if it really affected me. My therapist said the age gap made it questionable but I constantly invalidate myself. I do remember it leaving me scared and uncomfortable though.

She would also act out provocatively towards me in my preteen/teen years, doing things like telling me she’s selling feet pics, sitting on my lap and just being generally suggestive.

On top of that, I grew up with extremely strict but emotionally neglectful and somewhat abusive parents. I had a phone but everything was restricted except texts, calls, listening to music and photos. 

My mom also had a second device connected to my phone to monitor all the texts I was sending and receiving and is to this day nearly impossible to talk to. I’ve tried suggesting therapy to her for her anger to no avail.

So, with all that in mind, I would do some questionable things sexually that now plagues me with shame every single day of my life.

I used to take photos of whoever was around me and get off to them, including my own sister. I never snuck anywhere I shouldn’t have been and always knew not to force myself on anyone as hurting someone is my worst nightmare, but holy shit I will never forgive myself for this. 

One time when I was 11 or 12 I remember having her to send me a photo of her and her friends or something at a party too and got off to that as well. Thankfully I don’t think she suspected anything, but now I’m freaking out wondering if she’ll somehow find out in the future.


As soon as I had healthier outlets, this behavior stopped, but I literally can’t believe I ever did this to begin with. What the hell was I thinking!?!?

I don’t know I’m so sick of myself and everything I once enjoyed is slowly being taken from me due to the constant shame. That’s not who I am, I can’t believe it.

 I am a disgusting individual with no shot at being a good person.

Last night I had a really bad panic attack.
I felt like life was not really worth living anymore.
It was late and my SO was dead cold to my cries for help .
The PA felt like a heart attack with my body trembling I was sweating all over my heart was beating really fast. 
I felt like I was going to explode. Meanwhile she just stared at me with a blank look on her face the whole time. As I cried out for help telling her I didn't know what to do I needed help I needed help.
 Honestly I was considering calling 911 or driving myself to the hospital.
After you suffer for such a long time does anyone even care that you exist anymore.
Maybe the world would be a better place without me 

I'm a survivor of a horrific car accident where my car was hit sitting still on the highway during rush hour waiting for traffic to move. He was doing over 70 mph.
This was 2001.
10 years of intensive therapy.
Lots of therapy and medications and a half a dozen PTSD related doctors.

Just because I didn't try to do anything to leave this life behind I felt like I was just an annoyance.

I made a desperate post on this account last night and 1 person reached out to me and helped me to calm down.

Last night was one of the longest nights of my life.

I hate this PTSD

CW for mentions of gun trauma and death ?? No details though. 

I’m (23F) at a 6-week out-of-state job training program currently. We’re 5 weeks in and on the 6th week, starting Monday, we’ll begin discussing Security. I’ve been getting more and more anxious as it gets closer because I’m worried it will be triggering for me. I was held at gunpoint several years ago and then in October last year I was in a mass shooting, so as you can imagine, guns are not my friend. I’ve already talked about it with my instructors and they agreed to give me as much of a warning as possible and will let me sit in the back of the room, but there’s not much else they can do as it’s a required part of training. I will HAVE to stay in the room for the entirety of it. The Security training will last several days and I don’t know how to prepare myself for it. I have as-needed anxiety meds for my PTSD that I’m planning to take before each lesson but sometimes that’s not enough for me. I don’t want to break down in front of so many people, especially because I know it would spark questions I don’t want to answer. 

How can I mentally prepare myself? Any tips to keep myself sane? 

Side note for more context: I added that it’s a 6 week out of state program to emphasize how much more stress I’m under already. I’ve been away from my family and friends and my ESA cat for 5 weeks already and also on the 2nd week I found out someone I used to be very close with passed away. So I’m already at the end of my rope and that makes the whole security thing feel even more daunting. Any words of advice would be amazing.

reddit,1jn18sj,ptsd,2025-03-30 06:38:06,Anyone else lose the ability to speak and move during flashbacks?,"When I have a flashback, I almost always eventually lose the ability to speak, either completely or it just regresses to a few words at a time. I also have a weirdly hard time moving. My body just…shuts down.

It’s very frustrating for me, and can be scary for those around me. My boyfriend knows what to do during my flashbacks, but I’m terrified of what I’ll do when I go away to university at the end of the year. I hate not being able to communicate.

I’d love to know how common this is. I don’t know many other people with PTSD in real life, and haven’t heard them mention this.

Also, the trauma that caused my PTSD occurred when I was 12/13, so I don’t think this is age regression. I do act and feel like a child during flashbacks though, so maybe I subconsciously revert to a state where I was safe? 

I understand the freezing up part, it’s probably an anxiety thing, but the inability to speak scares me. It only ever happens to me during flashbacks, I don’t understand it fully and want to understand it better. 

I’ve done EMDR btw, which has helped greatly in the frequency of my flashbacks. They only happen like once a month now, but are still bad when they do happen.

I always dread flashbacks, and tend to fight against them while in public so I can still speak and move mostly if it happens at work, but once I’m in a safe space (at home), the flashback fully takes over and I can lose my ability to speak and move sometimes for an hour at a time if I tried to fight against it.

It’s also really embarrassing. I know logically during flashbacks that I CAN speak and move if I want, but I can’t make myself do it. I just completely dissociate and the harder I try to ignore it, the worse it gets.

Sorry if this doesn’t make sense. It’s purely a mental thing, by the way, it’s not like I’m paralyzed, and I wish I could figure it out. Maybe more EMDR would help, but I don’t have access to it right now.

While I was there my delusions calmed down and I stoped hearing voices due to sleeping through most of my stay there.

I got discharged Friday the 28th since I wasn’t suicidal (I never was to begin with I only wanted to harm myself since part of my delusions was that I needed to see blood to prove that I was a real person because other wise I thought my insides were wire and machinery) 

Everything was fine after my discharge for like less than 24 hours because afterwards my delusions came back worse than ever making me do things I didn’t want to do. I felt forced into what I was doing by an external force and could get a grip on reality. 

I had a session with my psychiatrist on Monday the 31st and she immediately told me I needed to go back inpatient and had me driven by a family member back to the hospital to get me readmitted I didn’t even get to see my therapist that day. I had a session scheduled right after my psych session. 

As soon as I got back inpatient I got really tearful and couldn’t stop crying my entire stay there. At this unit there was no therapist just a psychiatrist who you saw once a day in the morning and a sad excuse for group therapy where once maybe twice a day we would read a print out about something that wasn’t even remotely related to what I was going through and call it a day. I didn’t feel any support directly related to the issues I was facing. The facility itself was very very bleak (I know that’s how they normally are but I’ve been to multiple units and this one was by far the most depressing.) 

Anyways I got discharged today because I didn’t want to stay any longer and I wasn’t an active suicide risk so they couldn’t force me to stay although I was advised not to leave. 

Now I’m back in the outside world and am no longer in a manic episode like I had been the past 3 weeks and some of my delusions still linger and they won’t go away. 

My psychiatrist says I need to be evaluated for schitzoaffective disorder tho I don’t think I have it. I do find it strange that my magical thinking and delusions have stayed this long since usually they leave as soon as the episode is over. 

I guess I just need some words of advice and encouragement since inpatient didn’t do anything for me and I’m not sure where to turn.

My best friend took advantage of me. I let her live in my house because she was struggling and unfortunately for the wellbeing of my family I had to ask her to leave. She stole hundreds of dollars of decor/furniture poured coffee on my brand new carpets, ripped paint off my walls, tore towel racks and other fixtures out of the walls on the way out. She completely burned the bridge of our relationship and is still messaging me hurtful things and flat out lies. 

I’m successful in life but I believe it is because I hold myself accountable for my actions, I’m on medication, and I speak with a therapist when things get hard. 
Because I hold myself together so many people forget I’m bipolar and things trigger mel. Everyone is expecting me to just get over it and doesn’t understand why I’m depressed. 

I’m so heartbroken and I’m honestly so close to spiraling. I’ve been completely isolating the best I can to avoid letting this affect my family. 

I feel so used and unlovable. We were best friends for almost 11 years. Idk what I expect anyone to say I just don’t know who to talk to about this. 

I don’t know how to cope with losing people. I don’t wan to end up back in the hospital and I feel like I’m getting to that point because it just feels so hopeless.

I am having trouble living at home. My parents recently told me (after I moved in) that they are getting a divorce. My mom then told me she has been seeing another guy. We are still all living together. 

This has been a lot for me to juggle along with still trying to figure out the correct meds for bipolar II. I am starting to feel constantly depressed.

I want to move out but I’m afraid I’m not stable enough to live alone or with other people that aren’t family.

Which I did for a while with a psychiatrists help. However I got so low going off of them that I went back on them out of fear of killing myself.

I think it's being triggered by stress (a series of major traumatic life events in a short period of time) . It feels impossible to pull out of it. I need to slow down & find some calm, but it is just so hard. The kids have been home from school, and next week is spring break. You can't slow down when you have little kids. On top of the immense amounts of stress I've been under, I'm already stressing about being home with the kids on spring break. I'm scared that I won't be able to cope, and the stress of not being able to work or taking the kids to work, and trying to keep them entertained will break me. 

This week I impulsively told my crush that I like him, then got up & down as hell & bombed him with my dysregulated emotions when he told me he had a girlfriend (long story, he's been a friend for over a year, and told me he wanted to keep his personal life private, but how the hell do you not mention a girlfriend?!).  He did call to check in on me & apologize (he knows I have bipolar, and has been aware of my dysregulation). Still not cool, but regardless, I shouldn't be dumping my shit on him.

I'm struggling at work. It took me 3 hours to do payroll when it normally takes less than one. I'm having a hard time replying to texts, and have missed my last two psych appointments, as well as my daughters speech therapy. All this while I'm trying so hard to hold it together.

  
I love this group. While I have a great support system, I hate dumping my emotions on other people, and this has been a safe space for me to vent. Everyone on here has been so kind, given me great advice & support in some really dark times. I'm so thankful that I found it.

  
Anyway, thanks for listening. If anyone has advice on how to manage this shit while dealing with stress I'd love to hear it.

If rehab gave grades & feedback, I would have left with an A+ & a ‘Most Improved’, however, upon coming home, I hit a wall. 

I’ve always felt like an alien. Since I can remember, I’ve known I was different, and not in a fun way. I thought everyone else was normal and I was a freak, BUT if I stayed quiet nobody would see through my carefully constructed facade, and it fucking worked - for awhile.

A few obvious signs …
I’m weird about socks - they need to sit a certain way on my foot - no seams touching the sides - or else I literally cannot think about anything else. As a child, before I used my own hands or voice for my sock preference, this was a daily struggle for my poor mother, who genuinely thought I just hated socks because I would go psychotic.

Personal space issues - I absolutely had no idea what a personal ‘bubble’ was - and I am not exaggerating - until I was about 25. People thought I knew and just enjoyed making them uncomfortable, like a fucking psychopath. It literally took multiple people SEVERAL uncomfortable conversations before it sunk in.

Dating - I dated a man with Autism, I didn’t know for the first year, continued dating him for 3 years after that. 

I’m a savant - in reading comprehension. I scored a perfect 36 in reading on my ACTs and received 22-23 scores for the rest.

The fact that I’m 37 years old and just now finding out is a mixed bag.
When I look back, it’s obvious I was - Even my mom, who absolutely did NOT want to admit I am, finally started putting the pieces together. She actually brought that sock thing up the other day and apologized for not knowing then. But like, even I denied it at first! Not me- I’m too good with people (wasn’t always - lots of practice).

So here I am now? 
Just a skittles dish of disorders.
Some I can’t medicate, some I can. 
Some I have to explain to potential employers. 
Some I have to explain to potential lovers.

I feel defeated by my own brain. 
I feel like my life until this point has been one very long uphill battle, and finding out my diagnoses was me reaching the summit only to find a taller hill with worse terrain ahead.

Congratulations, this is never going to be easy.
Are you ready to fight every day for the rest of your already exhausting existence? 

Not today.
I’m fucking tired. I’m 37 years of suffering tired. I’m PTSD and ‘trigger words’ tired. I’m tired of talking to someone about how tired I am. I’m tired of having to explain myself 6 different ways to be understood, just to still not be understood. 

I became overwhelmed by the homework I was assigned just to have my idea of a normal life. Normies get to wake up and just be.
I have to wake up everyday and fight, and my enemy is my own brain.

I think I just needed a vent. 
Mental Illness sucks.
Now I gotta meditate or some shit to make up for the negative aura I just surrounded myself with. 

… One thing I took from therapy that I’m gonna leave here in case anyone needs to hear it-

I feel very isolated with my illness because I’m “tokenized” among my friends and colleagues for being so high functioning to the point where my difficulties get unnoticed, which is fine, because the alternative is having my friends/colleagues/director of my practice see me as a flight risk - which REALLY bothers me. Because of this and the idealization and pressure that people put on psychologists to be perfect beacons of mental health and wellness, (we’re not - hello, I am here), I feel like I’m masking 24/7 and like I’m not allowed to express my mental health difficulties, especially racing thoughts, poor impulse control, low self-esteem, and complex trauma etc because of how people perceive and idealize me based on my job. It’s complicated because I prefer being seen as idealized and high functioning but I also want my struggles seen, validated, and understood. So here I am being vulnerable on in an anonymous way on the Internet in hopes of connecting with folks who share my struggle. I feel so alone in this illness because I don’t feel “sick enough” but I am fucking sick enough. Please don’t come at me or question my clinical abilities because I have bipolar - I very much keep myself in check and have been a therapist for 12 years without mishap.

I hope everyone is doing well, and apologies in advance! 

For context, I’m diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD - the wombo combo! Also working as a Marketing strategist.

I'm currently destroying a job that I tried very hard to get, through a possible month-long depressive phase where I’m finding it incredibly difficult to work. 

I kind of went hypomanic and presented myself as a guy who can ideate and work like crazy. The management then proceeded to load my plate with all sorts of stuff (60% stuff I'm just not good at). I then crashed, burned out and now struggle to sit still and finish a single task. There is a high possibility that I will have to resign or be fired. 

And this has been a pattern in my life. It’s either the bipolar or the ADHD or both that screw me over. To the point that I haven’t really kept a steady, normal people job in the last 5 years.  

I'm tired of this. 

Side notes:
•	Medicated for bipolar – I take my meds ~80% of the time 
•	Have been suicidal in the past but then the meds keep those at bay
•	Current mood: consistently meh or gray with a side of anxiety about not working, job 
•	Current attitude about job: Kinda want to leave, be fired but then don’t because…you know…it’s a firing. 


I guess the point of writing all this is I’m kinda looking for someone with bipolar (with or without adhd) who sort of has their life together, or just advice in general.

reddit,1jpgowy,bipolar,2025-04-02 10:22:49,crashing and aging with bp2 and aging.,"I was officially diagnosed around 2010. I can't actually remember. But in any case I am now in my late 50s and I am really realizing the cycles that I've been going through this entire time, all these years.

My current diagnosis is BP 2 and I do take FDA approved medications, through a psychiatrist, and take them as prescribed. occasionally i forget a dose but take asap to get back on track.  I do not drink or do illicit drugs. I am single. I am using a throwaway account to avoid the obvious.

And so I am just coming off a hypo cycle that began in September. Realizing that it's been 6 months riding the wave is a little scary to me. Things have gotten more pronounced and harder to ignore the older I have gotten. It's very strange to realize that because when I was younger the symptoms were far more pronounced. Now, its the shift itself that seems more pronounced

But now that I am older it seems like it's more obvious. I I don't know how to quantify this and perhaps I am not making a whole lot of sense. What I'm trying to say is that although it's more obvious to me myself now what I am going through, some of the symptoms are getting more subtle. For example whereas I was hypersexual in my younger years, that never happens to me now. Instead it's overindulgence in Hobbies that require money, and so small spending sprees. There have been some large ones.

 But the thing that I'm struggling with right now is the crash. The crash feels harder these days. It's very strange feeling when you start falling slowly. 

Falling slowly is a weird, ultimately weird feeling. An object falls at 32 ft per second per second. Imagine falling 10 ft in 10 minutes. That's what this feels like. Like it's taking forever for me to come down off this hypomanic ride that I've been on since September. 

I find myself at work getting irritable when I am feeling provoked by customers. Side note: can we all just admit that customers are behaving badly and worse than ever in 2025? In my job they seem to want to provoke you into getting irritated with them so they can request things for free, or for some accommodation or concession by the company. It's emotional blackmail in my opinion but I am sure that that's another subject for another day and for another forum. I'm only mentioning it because it seems to be happening to me in my job currently and during this crash.


I guess I just need to vent and need a little Comfort but I also am hoping for older people like me, to offer some insight if they can, or some recommendation for coping mechanisms for these types of situations. This particular crash has really highlighted for me my yearly BP cycle. I am hypomanic and I spend the majority of every year in that state, when I am regularly medicated. When I was on a different medication it was reversed : heavily depressed for the majority of the year and hypomanic for a couple of months. The crashes weren't so obvious or as severe as they are now.

reddit,1jqcimy,schizophrenia,2025-04-03 13:22:28,Mental blocks are draining me,"Hi my name is Holly 26F and I’m having a hard time in my schizophrenia/treatment journey. This may get long but I really need support so I appreciate anyone that wants to help but please be nice im genuinely in a very fragile state of mind. I was 12 when I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia including a lot of traumatic psychosis several years beforehand. I guess technically depending on who you ask I could be considered early onset, yet I don’t recall much of my teen years nor my early adulthood because getting my diagnosis at 12 meant being approved for the “all mighty clozapine” and if you’ve been on that you may understand why I put it in quotation marks. The only thing I recall about being put on clozapine was being told at 12 I could pluck that hail bail from it(but it was apparently the only thing that would save me) I was put in the psych ward fully aware at 12 years old this could pluck me because I was being taken off meds for the first time since and this new so called miracle(literally what my mom called this damn drug) could ruin some white part of my blood that I couldn’t comprehend at the tender age of 12. My memories say I was put on meds around 5 or 6 cause my parents smashed it into my favorite juice and ruined that juice forever(I will never forget the flavor bro😭). I was on clozapine non stop till age 24(if I did the math right that’s 12 years) lol I have the blood draw scars and the permanent cognitive damage to prove it. Sadly, it all caught up to me and to prove a point when I stopped it, I did it cold turkey and I didn’t tell anybody for 6 months and I shouldn’t have done that but I did and I’m still here after round two with the clozapine super pluck risk. One day it hit kinda  me like a box of rocks that I was just sedated for so long and I’m still struggling with that right now…it’s only been two years since I’ve been off of clozapine. Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn’t have stopped it but then I remember my brain was addicted to the sedation, cause it made everything easier to block out so I could fully disassociate and I could forget my world ya know?(I was an AVID reader lol talk about another addictive deflection method dang) anyways lol I was back on track for a bit and I had been back on treatment and it started olanzapine, +2 separate anxiety/depression, meds. Although I realized that that was it was slowing me down, it’s not that I have beef with the medication cause I need it and I also know that schizophrenia is just not researched enough. I sometimes I feel like there has to be a better way than Literally inducing cognitive harm to combat and illness that also causes cognitive harm. I don’t know I guess it kinda baffles me but I’m also no neuroscientist or anything like that so who knows, I give everything a shot I’m a desperate girl just looking for aid in my head. I didn’t stop the olanzapine on purpose. It’s not something I wanted to do cause although I do not like antipsychotics affects I do feel like I also might be addicted to the sedation that they give, that does kind of rub me a little bit wrong because addiction runs in my bloodline as well as the mental illness. Please don’t mistake me I’m not one to just stop meds for no reason that’s simply not me at so this time it came down to transportation issues while I went out into the world, trying to be a big girl ,but it just led to me being stuck again. I wanna get back on that that train of treatment but I’m having this massive block and I went in and I got the orientation finished but something clicked and I got scared and now I started this new job and it’s something I’ve never done and it takes a lot of cognitive function and I’m really spiraling with little to no support and it’s making me feel like I’m about a dead end, I think I might be having delusions but then again I’m just a very logical person and I see things from a bigger perspective so I honestly I don’t know I genuinely feel like I just need encouragement right now.

I’ve tried calling crisis lines and looking for help, but they all tell me the same thing: “There’s nothing you can do unless she hurts herself or someone else.” That doesn’t feel right. She’s already in serious danger and I’m terrified something’s going to happen.

I'm currently on a monthly depot injection every month clopixol. I'm no longer on the mental health act and no longer under the composary treatment order. I'm trying to decide if coming off my injection is a good idea since im more than well enough now and been very stable for the last 8 years. I think im mentally well enough now to go without treatment for schizophrenia but it is worth taking the risk i don't want to relapse again and start all over again. But then theres a part of me that wants to the take the risk as i could be fine without treatment. I know theres people who have successfully come off treatment after years of having treatment for schizophrenia. Then theres people who relapse, would the best thing to do is slowly reduce my dose of my injection over a period of time to see how i go with a reduced dose then if that goes well then transition into having no depot injection at all.

Looking at the list of negative symptoms, I seem to match up with every one of them and they have only gotten worse since then. 

I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a week now and am thinking of antipsychotics and/or antidepressants to try to get me out of this crippling depression and anxiety that I've been feeling since the beginning of the year to try to see what works. Currently my biggest issues are disorganized thoughts, anhedonia, cognitive difficulties, alogia and avolition. I've heard good things about Abilify which I'm inclined to try because I feel like I seriously messed up my dopamine because I was previously taking SSRI/SNRI's for about 10 years for a diagnosis of depression and anxiety which I'm seriously questioning now obviously.

Knowing somebody who is effected by this, and being in a position to do a medium scale public facing project about it, I want to do something to be able to help, even if minimally. So far my concept will be around using anonymous testimonials from people with schizophrenia to be able to give the public a far more accurate representation of the people who have it, as many people's perception Is purely based on incorrect media and criminalising news headlines. I am here to ask if anybody with schizophrenia would be willing to write a short testimonial to give an insight into how it actually feels to have schizophrenia, and how you would like to be perceived by the public. This could be to do with how the stigma effects you, your experiences living day to day with the diagnosis, the inaccuracies of media compared to how the reality is, or anything you would like more people to be aware of. As I said, any testimonials would be used anonymously and no worries if you don't feel comfortable, but it would be a massive help.

You name it I was on it at some point. Idk when or how my therapy or whatever stopped. And I think I blocked alot of it out cause I don't remember anything except that I used to go there alot. And going to things with other kids that had tourettes. It completely turned me off from medication until I was suicidal and ended up getting help. Then anti depressants turned me to a zombie for 2 years. 

For a long time I have thought that there is some underlying medical condition doctors are missing. I have all kinds of random pains and it has only gotten worse. At my last job I felt like my chest was trying to rearrange itself and was convinced something is wrong with my heart. I went through numerous tests and had to take time off work, eventually quitting all together. Eventually doctors told me my heart is fine and it's stress related. I tried another job and same chest pains...

So I go to apply for disabilty. Doctor looks over medical history. I never remembered the ocd diagnoses. She wants me to be reassessed as it's been years since I've seen psychiatrist. But when I get home I look up ocd and exactly what it's all about. It was like reading a documentary about myself... And alot of the shit I was diagnosed with can supposedly lead to these pains if not treated. 

Now the big thing is.... I'm frigging homeless. Months ago I was doing good. My mental shit has literally gotten so bad it has cost me everything. Idk where I'm sleeping each night. I make split second decisions. I can't concentrate. My minds racing. And knowing that this is some mental shit... I feel like a failure. Like I can't control my own shit.

I feel unsafe to talk to anybody, my therapist broke confidentiality and told my sister I was cutting myself and that I was suicidal, I can’t tell them anything anymore, I can’t tell anyone anything anymore, nothing is safe, I can’t trust anybody. I hate myself, I hate my scars, I feel so disgusting. I know I am crazy, I know I am stupid, I know I am worthless and these pieces of knowledge only make my life worse, I can’t do anything about them, I must live with them because death is too risky. This world will keep me breathing and crippled until I am finally useless to it, and then I can be tossed aside.

I feel something really bad is going to happen, that my life is going to become much worse, that permanently things will change and I will be plunged deeper into deterioration, hatred, fear, and pain. People say they care about me, and to an extent I believe that some do, but it only makes things worse. It hurts when people care about me, it makes suicide seem selfish and suddenly my freedom feels revoked. Why does loneliness feel so awful when compassion is so painful?

I wish I could be sucked through my sheets and bedding into my own little world free from responsibilities keeping me tethered to this horrifying reality, where I can organize my bottles and bags and keep them close so they feel safe and warm and loved, where I can love my trash and keep my things close by, teach them to get along and feel included, no favoritism. Crumpled sheets and bottles of juice can’t feel insecure if they’re loved right, so I’ll keep them nice and close so they realize they’re not just trash or garbage, they were a part of my life and I want to go where they hold importance, where keeping them safe is my goal, where I can cover them up next to me and put on a nice program, bring some stuffed animals for warmth. I wish I could die and go there, away from all of this and be somewhere I don’t have to be alive, some fleshy prison, but where I can choose when I can and cannot be alive, where I get the choice, where I can just close my eyes and die for a while, though forever wouldn’t be so bad if it were my only choice, why must it be taken away from me? Just blink and I’m gone, stop worrying about me, forget about me, what does it matter? I’m so sick of people telling me I matter. I’m so sick of people telling me things will get better. Why can’t I just hide away where I can’t hurt anyone? Why must I remain functioning, why is breathing considered soooooooo essential?

I am a teenage girl with a lot of good friends and people to talk to. Not even trying to brag but I have a good amount of people (around 6) that have told me that they consider me one of their closest friends. My friend group is very open and we talk about problems with mental health/other topics all the time. They are all great unique people. Only problem is I feel like I can't connect on an emotional level to them at all. I don't think they realize this tho because I put a ton of effort into my friendships, maybe too much? I'm not sure. 

I do think this could be because I don't talk about my problems. Well my real ones. Idrk how to explain this but (I've also told my friends about this) I kinda have these lists in my head telling me what I can and cannot share. I use the things on my can list to make it seem like I don't hide everything and have problems. And ig they are problems but not as much of problems as the ones on my cannot list. 

Another thing is, this is gonna sound rlly self centered, I kinda feel like there's no one besides myself sometimes? Like I'm just in my own mind and there's no one else besides me in my brain. Idk if that makes sense but I just feel so alone yk. 

I also struggle with anorexia so that's pretty much all I think about 24-7. I have told absolutely no one about this. Maybe just the constant thinking in my brain without letting anything out is causing this emotional detachment but idk. 

And it's not as if my friends don't care. I've been told by a few that they talk about me with each other and how they're worried. They've always said I can talk to them if I want but I just can't.

I hate to say this but I also kinda view everyone as lists. Just lists of every attribute, good and bad, that I know of. I'v never rlly been able to have that feeling of ""oh I admire this person so much and I have this deep feeling of love/connection with them"". Both platonic and romantically. 

How do I fix this and if I can't how do I live with this? Any advice needed, sorry for the paragraphs. Thanks!

I have nothing to feel good about. My last 25 years working with nothing to show for it! I have lost all confidence, self belief, and enthusiasm for the future and I have also now developed anxiety and social anxiety. I'm currently jobless after being made redundant. I have nothing to offer any prospective partner and I'm feeling lonely and hopeless.

To make things worse I recently had my biggest ever win of just over £50,000 after finding a site which I wasn't excluded from. I even withdrew it and had it in my bank. This leads me on to where I am now and the bit most people won't understand. Despite this win being a massive opportunity to get my life back on track, maybe put a deposit down on a place to live and treat myself and my parents to a much deserved holiday, my addiction completely took over my state of mind. I completely lost control. I lost a small part of this win and as an addict, I had to win it back. In trying to do so I lost everything and I'm back to square one only without a job as well. It's only after doing it that reality hits along with the feelings of anger, depression, frustration and hopelessness. A massive reminder of why I can never gamble and have since excluded from every site I know about. 

This doesn't help my current situation. My parents are visibly getting older and older and are clearly starting to struggle. I could have treated them to an amazing holiday as a way of saying thank you but as usual I messed up with my addiction to blame. I completely understand that people will not understand. I don't even understand it myself.

I just do not know where to go from here. 42 and jobless with multiple issues with anxiety, social anxiety and depression, not to mention my gambling addiction.

It should not have to be stated that this is counterproductive.

No one person’s experience is the same as another’s. Just because you don’t struggle much with impulsive behaviors, that doesn’t mean everyone dealing with the same mental illness has the same areas of concern. The belief that, “I would never” is an illusion. Many of you are one bad experience away from stepping into the shoes of those you are judging. One bad day from your reality being completely reshaped. The kindness you are giving yourself should be extended to others. Especially if you are someone that fancies themself as “empathetic”. 

You can only speak for your own experience. Chances are that you are struggling with something that the person who you are shaming isn’t. You won’t be in a pleasant conversation long enough to know that.

Our normal therapy days are Tuesday, but she had gone on a trip so we rescheduled for Thusday. I arrived at her office and she wasn't there, I messaged her 3 mins before the appointment to ask if we were still on for that day. She responded apologizing profusely.

That day, I was feeling particularly suicidal, so after I read her message I just put my phone down and started driving to a public forest park. I genuinely did not have the energy to respond to anyone and I felt if I did, I would feel way too overwhelmed and I didn't want to feel pushed or guilty.

She had asked if I could do zoom and by the time I read her messages it was late and I didn't feel any energy to respond. I was just so unbelievably low. The next day I ended up driving a couple hours to my partner's house to decompress. I had messaged her after I settled down when I arrived there that I wouldn't be back until Sunday.

She has not responded back, when usually she always sends a message asking if we are still on for the appointment for the next day. I feel anxious but slight relief that she hasn't responded because I hate confrontation and conflict. I know it was an accident on her end, and I really understand things happen, but I can't stop feeling really off since I had been suicidal and she didn't show up for our appointment when I needed it the most at my lowest.

I don't know whether to message asking if she wants to have the appointment tomorrow, or just wait for her to mess age me back about it.

I'm still under 18 now, and have been told by 2 of my previous therapists I was silly for thinking I may have Bipolar Disorder because it's impossible to tell until you're 18 and they would get arrested if they diagnosed me. Until I was 12 it was mostly just unreasonable mood swings, even compared to other children and a hard time controlling what I knew was rage. It's been hard, since anger management skills don't seem to work as well. starting from when I was 12 (first confirmable Depression symptoms) I've noticed it was more than just 'anger issues' at play, I clearly had something else wrong. My symptoms tend to align more with Type 1 but my older half sister is diagnosed Type 2 and my mom almost got diagnosed with it as well but they decided it was just depression for her. My mom was always upset saying I was just like My dad (alcoholic) when I got mad. That I was just like my sister (to villanize her bipolar). She even told me I was like one of her exes (narcissist like abuser) for getting mad at her hoarding tendencies. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find help yet, much less a diagnosis since no one wants to diagnose a minor. I was considering inpatient at one point, but I know my parents definitely couldn't afford it and if they could wouldn't pay for it, reinforcing The stereotype the mental health treatment is only for people with like schizophrenia or something.

Now i dont know if this is the right flair to use but there were only three options

Disclaimer: I am religious ish
Please dont comment anything about religious psychosis ,Bad mouthing religion ,Mentioning politics etc [I hear it enough and it drives me crazy]

I just want to know whats your life like or your childhood and what horrible BS do/Did have to live with

Cause i have been through alot of shiz

Number one:
One thing is i have a ED that is no longer a ED 
I was always a chubby kid ive never been skinny not even once i was always fed alot meaning i was allowed to eat alot then it became emotional eating i was made fun of alot as a kid [90% percent of it was at home i wasnt really bulled at school about my weight maybe just two occasions thats it]

Turns out and i didnt even know this people were talking about it in my face and behind my back as a kid [In my family & Extended family] Fat was always the word i remember at one point at thanksgiving i was still in grade school [Not middle nor highschool] the first time i ever emotionally because a family member said i was gonna x amount of pounds [Keep in mind i was a child] i was also always on a bunch of diets Weight watchers ,Jenny craig ,Locks on the cabnets ,Low cal/Low carb diets i was 5/6 years old when i first started a diet i remember Jillian Michael's Yall remember her and another lady that did walking miles dvds and a couple of other cardio people of course none of these worked my weight was always the vocal point of things it was the only thing interesting about me it was how fat i was by my family [Mainly parents ,Grandparents ,Aunts ,Uncles ,Several cousins] Basically alot of people i was around most of the time it was either to my face or behind my back] So in a way i had no support i literally had no one just me myself and i have never know i think 6 or 7 years old was the last time i ever felt the concept called happiness or happier then later on i am now 25 years old.....yes Honest to God its been that long i have only felt pain and suffering and wanting to die since i was 10 getting yelled at ALOT ,Making fun of my weight ALOT ,Getting called weird or crazy ALOT no one to actually care about me i was a burden i dont want to sugarcoat anything lets be 100% i was but i havent even gotten started yet with this vent theres way more detail

Number two: The Physically and mentally sick kid who dropped out of school

I have had several several surgeries in my life i also have severe asthma ,Heart & Kidney Problems ,High blood pressure [Not weight related its genetics] besides the mental issues i had this all caused me to miss SO MUCH SCHOOL either involuntarily or voluntary i could go to school do to surgeries but i did have tutors [The only reason i went on to the next grade] but i also got sick CONSTANTLY Whether it was severe allergy's to the point i couldnt see nor function ,Getting the Flu a bunch of times [Despite me getting the Flu shots i stopped getting them since they did absolutely nothing] then later on in middle school i was so mentally down the drain i didnt even want to go to school besides i had so much homework like alot in late elementary school and middle school and i could hardly do it cause i didnt understand I had a IEP and have a Learning disability i tried my hardest but to me it always seemed like my parents and the teachers didnt think i applied myself even though i had sleepless nights trying to do my work i could get it basic math was even a struggle for me to get especially when im doing a timed test [Being timed doesnt mix with me] i did public school ,Private school even online school eventually i dropped out cause i didnt get the help i needed or the help i shouldve gotten so everyone is Graduating except me....also school didnt help me feel any less like a mistake i HATED the awarded stuff you get for getting good grades ,The perfect attendance awars etc Any award a  school offered i never got another reason i felt like i was never good enough

And also if you have a disability or you are bound to a will chair then you know field trips [At least most of them] were hell if you were in a wheel chair there was always field trips that had no ramps/Places with only stairs ,If you couldnt walk for long or used crutches or a cane etc there was always field trips with so much WALKING and i get that people can't always cater to Disabled people but their was so much less and i mean SO MUCH LESS field trips for disabled people for me it was that i didnt go or i had to force myself to be in pain

Number 3: My identity and who i am
[Disclaimer: Religion had nothing to do with this so please dont make a connection cause i feel like some people will]

I had identity issues since i was a teenager i went from straight to Bi to straight then to Not identifying with a gender to being both Genders then to being a women then to going back and forth back and forth then to not existing then to bi again then to Different genders then straight and a women again [Yeah this is alot and went on for years] i also had a borderline koreaboo phase which my worth and identity was in Korean/Asian culture literally Crying or getting angry at people who were rude about kpop [This sounds straight insanity]

anything about religious psychosis Bad mouthing religion Mentioning politics etc I hear it enough and it drives me crazy I just want to know whats your life like or your childhood and what horrible BS do Did have to live with Cause i have been through alot of shiz Number one One thing is i have a ED that is no longer a ED I was always a chubby kid ive never been skinny not even once i was always fed alot meaning i was allowed to eat alot then it became emotional eating i was made fun of alot as a kid 90 percent of it was at home i wasnt really bulled at school about my weight maybe just two occasions thats it Turns out and i didnt even know this people were talking about it in my face and behind my back as a kid In my family Extended family Fat was always the word i remember at one point at thanksgiving i was still in grade school Not middle nor highschool the first time i ever emotionally because a family member said i was gonna x amount of pounds Keep in mind i was a child i was also always on a bunch of diets Weight watchers Jenny craig Locks on the cabnets Low cal Low carb diets i was 5 6 years old when i first started a diet i remember Jillian Michael s Yall remember her and another lady that did walking miles dvds and a couple of other cardio people of course none of these worked my weight was always the vocal point of things it was the only thing interesting about me it was how fat i was by my family Mainly parents Grandparents Aunts Uncles Several cousins Basically alot of people i was around most of the time it was either to my face or behind my back So in a way i had no support i literally had no one just me myself and i have never know i think 6 or 7 years old was the last time i ever felt the concept called happiness or happier then later on i am now 25 years old yes Honest to God its been that long i have only felt pain and suffering and wanting to die since i was 10 getting yelled at ALOT Making fun of my weight ALOT Getting called weird or

genetics besides the mental issues i had this all caused me to miss SO MUCH SCHOOL either involuntarily or voluntary i could go to school do to surgeries but i did have tutors The only reason i went on to the next grade but i also got sick CONSTANTLY Whether it was severe allergy s to the point i couldnt see nor function Getting the Flu a bunch of times Despite me getting the Flu shots i stopped getting them since they did absolutely nothing then later on in middle school i was so mentally down the drain i didnt even want to go to school besides i had so much homework like alot in late elementary school and middle school and i could hardly do it cause i didnt understand I had a IEP and have a Learning disability i tried my hardest but to me it always seemed like my parents and the teachers didnt think i applied myself even though i had sleepless nights trying to do my work i could get it basic math was even a struggle for me to get especially when im doing a timed test Being timed doesnt mix with me i did public school Private school even online school eventually i dropped out cause i didnt get the help i needed or the help i shouldve gotten so everyone is Graduating except me also school didnt help me feel any less like a mistake i HATED the awarded stuff you get for getting good grades The perfect attendance awars etc Any award a school offered i never got another reason i felt like i was never good enough And also if you have a disability or you are bound to a will chair then you know field trips At least most of them were hell if you were in a wheel chair there was always field trips that had no ramps Places with only stairs If you couldnt walk for long or used crutches or a cane etc there was always field trips with so much WALKING and i get that people can t always cater to Disabled people but their was so much less and i mean SO MUCH LESS field trips for disabled people for me it was that i didnt go or i had to force myself to be in pain Number 3 My identity and who i am Disclaimer Religion had nothing to do with this so please dont make a connection cause i feel like some people will I had identity issues since i was a teenager

TW: mentions of COCSA, parental neglect and general grossness


Hi. I am extremely ashamed about some things I did years ago (around age 11-15 or so) and I just seriously don’t see a way out. I’d appreciate some kind advice

For some context, I may have been SA’d at a very young age by my sister who is almost 4 years older than me, although it wasn’t really that bad and I don’t know if it really affected me. My therapist said the age gap made it questionable but I constantly invalidate myself. I do remember it leaving me scared and uncomfortable though.

She would also act out provocatively towards me in my preteen/teen years, doing things like telling me she’s selling feet pics, sitting on my lap and just being generally suggestive.

On top of that, I grew up with extremely strict but emotionally neglectful and somewhat abusive parents. I had a phone but everything was restricted except texts, calls, listening to music and photos. 

My mom also had a second device connected to my phone to monitor all the texts I was sending and receiving and is to this day nearly impossible to talk to. I’ve tried suggesting therapy to her for her anger to no avail.

So, with all that in mind, I would do some questionable things sexually that now plagues me with shame every single day of my life.

I used to take photos of whoever was around me and get off to them, including my own sister. I never snuck anywhere I shouldn’t have been and always knew not to force myself on anyone as hurting someone is my worst nightmare, but holy shit I will never forgive myself for this. 

One time when I was 11 or 12 I remember having her send me a photo of her and her friends or something at a party while in the bathroom in the hotel room we were in while on family vacation and got off to that as well. Thankfully I don’t think she suspected anything, but now I’m freaking out wondering if she’ll somehow find out in the future. I fucking hate myself.


As soon as I had healthier outlets, this behavior stopped, but I literally can’t believe I ever did this to begin with. What the hell was I thinking!?!?

I don’t know I’m so sick of myself and everything I once enjoyed is slowly being taken from me due to the constant shame. That’s not who I am, I can’t believe it.

 I am a disgusting individual with no shot at being a good person.

It's too long for Reddit, but I'd appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and can offer help.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD, depression and anxiety, but what's really devastating me is the combination of three interconnected challenges:

1. **Poor memory**: Severely impaired across all types - short term, long term, working memory, and especially recall (cued recall works slightly better). Information doesn't seem to properly encode in the first place, my life feels like a camera that isn't recording anything.
2. **Lack of emotions**: Complete emotional numbness, very unreactive no feelings whatsoever.
3. **Blank mind**: No spontaneous thoughts, automatic associations, opinions, and struggle to think on the spot. Can’t problem-solve real-time situations.

This has been lifelong but has really caught up with me in my 20s (I’m 26). The implications are devastating - extreme alienation, no sense of self or continuity, inability to build on past experiences, can't sustain relationships, constant anxiety and dissociation. Nothing feels real or important, and I never know what to do with myself. I'm quite suicidal and desperate because of this.

My social functioning is severely impacted. I can't hold basic conversations, connect with people, or maintain relationships. I've developed seriously avoidant behaviors and isolation as a result.

I'm currently trying therapy, medication (SSRIs, stimulants), supplements and various lifestyle changes. I exercise regularly, maintain a healthy diet, and practice meditation. None of this has helped with the core issues.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone in this community has experienced similar symptoms or has any insights. I'm looking for specialized treatment approaches, relevant research, or professionals who understand these specific cognitive issues.

Has anyone here found relief or improvement for similar lifelong symptoms?

My brain I've noticed tends to find patterns and resemblances between people or correlates different things with certain people. For example, I have a friend who's made it pretty much their entire personality the fact that they have green eyes, well, anytime I see someone with green eyes, all I can think about is my friend, this messes me up a lot on the day to day, for example, if let's say a girl happens to be interested in me, and I'm digging her vibe and it seems like we could hit it off, if she happens to have green eyes, all my brain will think about is the fact that my friend also has green eyes, and boom every time I see this girl, I'm reminded of my friend, even though the similarities don't go beyond the fact that they both have green eyes.   
  
But these sort of unwanted persistent thoughts usually manifest in other areas as well, for example, one of my friends expressed their type being Latinas, and although previously I gave no consideration about the racial background of women I myself find attractive, anytime I see an attractive women who happens to be a Latina, my brain instantly connects this to the fact that my friend likes Latina women, and then it's subsequently all I can think about. Or in another way, if let's say my brain suddenly realizes that some random person on the street or in my class or whatever, has some feature which resembles a feature from another person I know, all I can think about is that feature and the person that they resemble. So some random girl I may have found attractive, well too bad, her nose happens to be the same shape as my mom's or my sister's or my friend in middle school and then boom, that's all I can ever seem to think about afterwards.

And it is hard for me to talk about it, because I am a man. I know that people have to deal with far worse demons than I have to. I would say that I somewhat have my life together and I somewhat feel strong. Still there is that other side of me that comes out every now and then. Sometimes more regularly sometimes less. That side that absolutely despises itself. That side that pities itself, because it cannot help but feel defeated. 

And I am in a weird position. Because I usually gaslight myself into thinking that everything is fine and I just need to stop being a b\*\*ch. Especially when I am in a good state I feel ashamed of ever thinking that I would have some kind of mental illness.

But I do know that something just is not right. Over the years I have only engaged in self-harm 3-4 times and never majorly. But the point is, I did engage in it and I don't think a healthy person would do so. At the moment I also do not see myself in danger of taking my own life, but I did have my thoughts and fantasies about it.

I know that the first step of taking ownership about my mental health is talking to a professional. And I already made an effort. I called the doctor's office last month and am currently waiting for a call-back, which can take a while since they have a lot to do.

My childhood, you can say, was seemingly joyful, I had no trauma that would trigger me up until I was 10. My grandfather, who was most important figure in my life, died from cancer and that greatly impact on me and it was just a beginning of mood change I couldn't explain. Most of times I'd absolutely disociate; I feel not present. And as I reached my teens, it didn't stopped; slowly most of my time I had difficuilties with emotions.

When it comes to socializing it was hard since I was bullied and was alienated from everyone and my classmates took bullying to another level to the point of me having suicidal thoughts. 

Friendships to me were me seeking some strange validation from others. I tried to blend in, and when I do have a friend it's a total screw up; I get way too much attached, when they don't message straight away, I fear they'll just leave because of something I do. 

These feelings often go, and come back like last year. I lost four people from my family and it took a tool on me. 

I know what you'll ask the answer is: seeking therapist in my country is hard because it's frowned upon, you immediately are considered a lunatic without a problem.

I just miss how things used to be and the people that were part of life at the time, and I feel like I'll never as 'happy' as was I back then.

reddit,1jnhfxr,mentalillness,2025-03-30 22:51:11,I don’t feel like myself anymore—could this be a mental health issue?,"Dear all, I need advice because my quality of life is really bad right now. I'm 23M.

Over the last four years, I feel like I’ve become a different—and worse—person.

Those years were filled with a lot:

Four intense years of engineering studies (I’ve now graduated).

Living with my mom who was deeply depressed, taking sleep meds that never really helped, and even became suicidal. (She’s finally doing better now, thankfully.)


During that time, I coped in ways I’m not proud of: watching p*rn excessively, smoking pot, and drinking at parties. I also struggled a lot with body image and low self-esteem.

Here are the results I’m left with:

Constant inner monologue and overthinking

Anxiety around people: I worry about what to say before, during, and after social interactions

Poor memory, forgetfulness, weak focus, and frequent brain fog

My mind goes blank around people. I can’t connect emotionally or think of things to say naturally

I live in my head. I’m no longer spontaneous, witty, or creative like I used to be

My thoughts are disorganized, and I ruminate constantly

Self-esteem and confidence are way down

I feel dumber, slower, and not as sharp mentally

I used to love socializing—it gave me life. Now it feels like a chore. I’m just surviving, not living


Funny enough, when I dream, I feel like my old self: present, connected, and happy. I want that version of me back.

One year ago, I decided to take serious action:

I fixed my sleep

I started exercising daily

I quit pot and alcohol completely

I went 100 days without p*rn. The first month was really tough, but then it got better


These changes helped—not so much with the anxiety around people to be honest, but they improved my mood during alone time. I also gained some confidence physically and felt a little more stable overall.

Nevertheless, something still feels off:

I still can’t connect emotionally

I still can’t socialize naturally

My mind is still overactive and exhausting

I still ruminate, can’t be spontaneous, and feel mentally slower than I used to

I still feel like I’m not myself

My confidence is still lacking

I still have cognitive issues—focus, memory, forgetfulness, mental clarity—all still weak

I don’t feel creative, sharp, or excited about things

I feel dumber and not as sharp as I used to be


And this is coming from someone who, before age 19, always felt smart, witty, and funny. Confidence issues were there, but not nearly as strong. I used to think clearly, joke easily, and connect naturally with people.

Eventually, I relapsed after 100 days of no p*rn, and I’m not sure why.

One time, while high on pot, I suddenly felt alive again—present, witty, spontaneous. I cracked jokes and connected with everyone around me. I felt like me again. And people noticed it too.

So I’m wondering:
Is my problem just a mindset/lifestyle issue? Or do I need to see a doctor?

Now that college is over and my mom is better, many of the heavy external problems are gone. All that remains is my job search—and whatever is going on with my brain and mental state.

I feel blocked. Am I broken forever? Or am I still here, just buried under something?

I’m willing to do whatever it takes. I’m a fighter. I’ve already taken steps, and I want to keep going. But I need direction.

Should I restart my no p*rn journey and go beyond 100 days, hoping it’s the root of these issues?
Or could this be something like ADHD, anxiety, or depression that requires medical support?

Please let me know what you think. I just want my life back.

Thank you.",I don t feel like myself anymore could this be a mental health issue Dear all I need advice because my quality of life is really bad right now I m 23M Over the last four years I feel like I ve become a different and worse person Those years were filled with a lot Four intense years of engineering studies I ve now graduated Living with my mom who was deeply depressed taking sleep meds that never really helped and even became suicidal She s finally doing better now thankfully During that time I coped in ways I m not proud of watching p rn excessively smoking pot and drinking at parties I also struggled a lot with body image and low self esteem Here are the results I m left with Constant inner monologue and overthinking Anxiety around people I worry about what to say before during and after social interactions Poor memory forgetfulness weak focus and frequent brain fog My mind goes blank around people I can t connect emotionally or think of things to say naturally I live in my head I m no longer spontaneous witty or creative like I used to be My thoughts are disorganized and I ruminate constantly Self esteem and confidence are way down I feel dumber slower and not as sharp mentally I used to love socializing it gave me life Now it feels like a chore I m just surviving not living Funny enough when I dream I feel like my old self present connected and happy I want that version of me back One year ago I decided to take serious action I fixed my sleep I started exercising daily I quit pot and alcohol completely I went 100 days without p rn The first month was really tough but then it got better These changes helped not so much with the anxiety around people to be honest but they improved my mood during alone time I also gained some confidence physically and felt a little more stable overall Nevertheless something still feels off I still can t connect emotionally I still can t socialize naturally My mind is still overactive and exhausting I still ruminate can t be spontaneous and feel mentally slower than I used to I still feel like I m not myself My confidence is still lacking I still have cognitive issues focus memory forgetfulness mental clarity all still weak I don t feel creative sharp or excited about things I feel dumber and not as sharp as I used to be And this is coming from someone who before age 19 always felt smart witty and funny Confidence issues were there but not nearly as strong I used to think clearly joke easily and connect naturally with people Eventually I relapsed after 100 days of no p rn and I m not sure why One time while high on pot I suddenly felt alive again present witty spontaneous I cracked jokes and connected with everyone around me I felt like me again And people noticed it too So I m wondering Is my problem just a mindset lifestyle issue Or do I need to see a doctor Now that college is over and my mom is better many of the heavy external problems are gone All that remains is my job search and whatever is going on with my brain and mental state I feel blocked Am I broken forever Or am I still here just buried under something I m willing to do whatever it takes I m a fighter I ve already taken steps and I want to keep going But I need direction Should I restart my no p rn journey and go beyond 100 days hoping it s the root of these issues Or could this be something like ADHD anxiety or depression that requires medical support Please let me know what you think I just want my life back Thank you,1,0,ways I,Aggressive-Slice-179,https://reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jnhfxr/i_dont_feel_like_myself_anymorecould_this_be_a/,0.9902,0.07621937768489492,High,Positive

reddit,1jqbx0n,therapy,2025-04-03 12:41:29,How do i move on from an abusive relationship?,"TW: Abuse, Cutting, blood

2 years ago i moved across the the country to move in with my now ex.

Before i met her i was a completely different person. I was more positive and willing to see a lot of things through. I got out of a really long relationship before that and saw my mistakes and did everything i could to not make the same mistakes.

After the relationship i just feel voided. Not exactly nothing but something isnt right. Im not a happier person just more content, i dont go out as much and i dont contact my friends anymore.

Ever since dating her i felt as if i was some sort of chain on people. She told me before we broke up a lot of stuff she didnt like about me to my face (she was drinking) and it sort of stuck with me. She said she didnt love me before and that stuck too.

It makes me wonder if me simply being around is causing some kind of anguish for people and it hurts but i dont let it, if that makes sense.

Shes cheated on me, hit me and even harmed herself over small issues. She has BPD and i would try to get her to take her medication often even though sometimes she just wouldnt. She cut herself over the wifi and almost bled out in the bathroom and its a lot for a 22 year old.

Im 24 now and i dont feel healed. I get so scared of being in any relationship and even simple friendships are hard to get into now since im now always defensive. My guard is up, im always on social media now and i feel like ive gotten mean.

My job doesn't pay me enough for me to get therapy but i 100% know i need it but cant afford it. I want to figure out how to move on and live like i did before i met her. Now i feel as if im scared of everything and nothing at the same time and it feels physically crushing.

I come from a turbulent family with a lot of early childhood abandonment, neglect, abuse, etc. And lifelong generational trauma from my adoptive grandmother. Very much a Cinderella kinda vibe. 

Atop that I was recently fired from my last job due to blatant disability discrimination. 

I'm just. Crushed and struggling and I feel frustrated that I have been essentially sabotaged even before I was out of the womb. 

Life has been mostly terrible, but I still keep powering through as best I can.
I finally found a ""trauma informed"" therapist, but I don't feel like I really get much of anything out of talking with her? 

I'll tell her about ""my mom used to do these things, and then losing my job made me feel X, Y, Z.""
And it feels more like I'm just. Talking AT someone rather than getting anything out of it? 
I said I wanted a place to vent and be heard and have feelings validated, but also like.... IDK how to ""improve""?

I'll tell her ""I was sad this week""

She asks ""Why?""

I explain ""because I was sick and still forced myself to be productive because I'm anxious if I'm not constantly being productive.""

She asks ""why do you think you feel that way?""

I answer ""because as a child, I hoped being perfect enough would mean my adoptive mom wouldn't screen and get mad at me and blame me for making her life miserable, even though it was unfair and out of my control.""

""Yeah, that sounds rough.""


And I'm just like....
Yes. I know. 

I've already analyzed my trauma to death. I understand that my body reacts these ways because of trauma but like. Surely there's more to therapy beyond just. Telling a therapist how I feel and why I feel that way. I already know why. I anticipate everything she asks. 

It's just CBT therapy and I've done CBT to death through myself because I could never find a trauma informed therapist.

reddit,1jq9cx7,therapy,2025-04-03 10:02:33,"I was falsely accused, and it sent my spiraling.","I’ve been sitting with this for a while. I haven’t talked about it publicly. Not even with my parents until recently. But it’s been eating at me from the inside out, and I just need to say it somewhere—so here I am.

A few months ago, someone I used to be close with—let’s call her C—falsely accused me of something very gross, disgusting, and disturbing. The accusation was completely baseless, and it came out of nowhere. She made it to people I considered friends. They took her at her word. No questions, no evidence—just immediate distance. She later admitted to my partner that she never had proof and, in fact, never even believed it herself. But by then, the damage was done.

I tried to stay calm. I tried to be rational. I showed my friends everything—texts, timelines, transparency. Still, I was shunned. I was isolated, lied about, and treated like a villain. My name was passed around like a rumor in a high school hallway, and I felt powerless to stop it.

The worst part? I respected C. I thought we had resolved everything from the past. We used to be close, and I trusted her. Then she took that trust and flipped it on its head.

For months, I spiraled. I wrote my pain down—every thought, every question, every internal courtroom I put myself through. It became a kind of therapeutic journal, built around the metaphor of a trial. I needed to make sense of what happened. I needed to give myself the clarity and justice no one else would. It became very extensive and I've ran it through multiple drafts and copies with every word, line, and formatting all extremely deliberate. 

I still don’t fully understand why she did it. Maybe projection. Maybe resentment. Maybe she just wanted to watch me fall. But I do know this: I didn’t deserve what happened. And the people who turned their backs on me without hesitation? They never really knew me.

This is not me looking for sympathy. It’s not me trying to redeem myself. I know who I am. I know the truth. I’ve lived it. I’ve written it. This is just me finally saying it out loud:

I was falsely accused. And it nearly broke me.

And I am still here trying to pick up all my pieces.

Over the last few months I’ve been hating myself. Every little mistake I messed up. I felt like every person I interacted with I was an issue or an inconvenience. My grades were decreasing really bad and my nightmares were messed up. Like they would be repeating my trauma over shootings or even losing all my friends. I hated myself so much at that time I started to SH myself and I regret it I’ve only done it twice but my brother found out and I think I traumatized him and I feel even more disgusted.That was two weeks ago. My friends also found out and they were concerned and worried



I already told my great grandma about the SH and told me I was gonna get help. When I tried to talk to my mom I didn’t tell her about what I did but I told her about my problems with nightmares. She acknowledged I have depression but she literally said after “But you do realize we all do right”. When she said 
that my heart sank. It felt like I was being heard but I the same time I couldn’t tell her so she wouldn’t understand. My mom is a good person who dose so much for me but I feel like I can’t talk to her about my mental health when we were in the car I told her about how I feel when I’m inside church and she said my emotions can sometimes lie to us and it kinda hurt. She told me we were gonna get help but I don’t trust her because when I had a traumatic experience she said we’re gonna get therapy but it been 3 years she tried bringing me to church but it went
 downhill.



Now I threw everything away but now I feel weird. I feel like I hurt so many people after I harmed myself and I hate myself even more. Even when I type this I feel sick in myself I’ve been lying to half of my family and friends and I feel like crying every night because I feel like it’s all partially my fault. My nightmares keep getting worst and I can’t sleep sometimes. Even today I had a dream that my mom and aunt found out about my cuts and they hugged me and told me it would be ok. But I refuse to believe that will happen it’s gonna go downhill if they found out. I hope that willI hope she gets me therapy but if she doesn’t I’ll just have to ask someone else. So that’s basically it

reddit,1jq8he3,therapy,2025-04-03 09:15:06,How can I ever forgive myself?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years. 1 month ago, she broke up with me for the first time thinking that I didn’t care about our future. We “got back together” a day later after numerous communication that reflected our communication breakdown previously. Now things are slow, nothing beyond hugging and holding hand. Sex definitely is non existent now as she can’t even look at me naked. We have only started kissing again lately. 

Rebuilding has been extremely tough. Apart from some family issue on her side (which is more or less resolved), her work has been EXTREMELY tough and she has been working overtime, resulting in significant reduced in hangout time. Occasionally, she will be too stressed and tired with work, so our conversation wouldn’t flow well in text. I’ve been giving her some suggestions regarding changing job and she took it well initially. But when she got stressed with responsibilities again, I can’t bring it up without making her feel resentful. We are supposed to meet on Friday for our weekly weekday catchup, but it’s not happening anymore as her boss is demanding her to work overnight so her shift is starting at 6pm. 

I’ve been living with a lot of regrets these days. Images of me causing hurt to her are replaying in my head indefinitely. I could see the image or her crying because I was ignorant last time and all she wanted was for me to be certain about our future together especially in a country where we are unrecognised. I failed to give that to her and has always been doing my own future planning behind her back. Ultimately my goal is to get a house with her so I’ve been saving and working hard. But I didn’t say this to her and in fact has always given her the impression that I didn’t care through other means. I only said it on the day of the breakup, causing her to rethink the situation again as she said she still loves me a lot. I regretted it so bad that it’s haunting. I’m in therapy right now just so that I could try to forgive myself as much as possible in order to stay grounded and give her the stability and certainty she has always needed. 

I’m angry at myself for making my “the one” go through all those pain and I just want to do everything to make her feel safe again. She’s the one and I love her. It’s now haunting me that I hurt her.

I am 28, I'm 5'8 and have struggled with my weight for the better part of the last 14 years. I am overweight, and the way that my body looks to me is really difficult to cope with. 

The funny thing is, 5 years ago I was in a horrible relationship and during it I was down to what I would consider a goal weight. About 170 pounds. But I thought I was still just so fat. I worried over my shape in the mirror, I compared myself to my girlfriend at the time who was never more than 120 pounds. I was the weight I now wish I could be, but I was miserable. 

Now Im in a wonderful relationship with my beautiful wife, but I am nearing 250 and I cry over my reflection. I cant look at pictures of myself that my wife takes, I struggle so much. I find other women my size and bigger even to be the most voluptuous beautiful creatures on this planet, but I have this horrible view of myself. 

I need a therapist, but I have no idea what I need from it, I dont know how much it will help, I dont have a goal. I suppose I just want to not think horrible terrible things about myself. 

Does anyone else here struggle with their weight, does anyone have advice for what kind of therapist I should seek out? Im not terribly concerned with losing weight, I think. I can eat better and go to the gym all I want, even when I'm ""skinny"" I hate my body.

Recently started seeing a new one. First male therapist I’ve ever had but what’s even more odd is that he’s an old school psycho-analyst. All my therapists up to this point have been either talk or CBT, so it’s interesting to be paired with someone new.

However… I’ve taken a couple psychology courses so I know a little bit about the basics and I thought psycho-analysis was put out to pasture. Had to bite my tongue a few times so I didn’t say “I’m surprised you guys are still around” or something like that.

We’ve only had one session where I basically had to rapid fire recount where I was with my last therapist and I was skeptical to begin with but right away I’m already feeling unsure about him. Seems like he’s trying to analyze me and other people in my right away. Recounting how my relationship with my ex went, he spared no time in speculating that my ex had BPD or NPD. And I was like “well, you don’t need to flatter me. Like, there’s two sides to every story and while my ex was a bitch for how she treated me, I don’t think she had BPD or anything worse.”

Anyway, I’m just wondering if anyone else has seen a psycho-analyst before and what your opinion is on it and if it can help me in ways that CBT or talk therapy have failed.

reddit,1jq6xc6,therapy,2025-04-03 07:55:56,I'm pretty sure my therapist of 3 years joined a cult and ghosted me. (long),"**TLDR:** My therapist of 3 years ghosted me through a cryptic text without warning. I contacted their business partner, who informed me they were *'on a spiritual awakening that most wouldn't understand.'* At this point, I became extremely concerned and called the local authorities to perform a wellness check as this behavior was way out of character, and the partner sounded crazy. Fortunately, the therapist turned out ok, but I am pretty sure they joined a cult.


**Long Version:**

This post is long, so I broke it into two sections. First, I will explain what happened. I feel like the details matter.

**Details:**

For the last three years, I have had a therapist/business coach that I met weekly via phone call. They would help me analyze business decisions, manage stress, and work on myself. I thought the relationship was strong and would continue for at least the near future.

We meet every Wednesday evening, and on Tuesdays, I receive a text message appointment reminder. This week was no different, and the text arrived around noon.

*'Hello GhostOnTheCouch! I look forward to talking with you tomorrow at 4:00!'*

I always assumed these were done by hand because they were always worded differently and would come at various times. Which is why the subsequent text was unexpected.

5 hours later, I receive this:

*'Hi GhostOnTheCouch,*

*I want to let you know that I'm no longer able to continue our work together. My internal structure and work have shifted in a way that no longer allows me to hold this container. This decision is final and not open for discussion. I appreciate the time we've shared, and I wish you the best moving forward.'*

I can't stress enough how out of character this text is. There is simply no way this therapist would end a working relationship this way. So I immediately responded with:

*'Hey Therapist. Not sure what's going on. This doesn't sound like you. Is everything ok?'*

I waited a bit, and after receiving no response, I called the therapist. Someone answered but didn't/wouldn't say anything. At this point, I am really thinking something is wrong. I called the therapist's business partner, and was met with this:

*'Thank you for your concern. We are on a spiritual awakening right now that few will understand. The therapist is safe and fine.'*

Then they hung up. I honestly didn't know what to do at this point, so I called my buddy, who is a police officer. They recommended I call in a wellness check, especially given the odd nature of the communications.

Long story short that is what I did. The therapist lives several states over, but I remember enough about their details when we talked over the years that I was able to pin down an address and contact the authorities.

They did the check and talked to the therapist, and the therapist was okay. Police said they (the therapist) meant to send the text, and that the therapist added that they did not join a cult.

So there we are. This is how my therapist of 3 years ended the relationship. On April 1st no less.

**Thoughts:**

This whole thing is unreal, unexpected, and just crazy.

I really engaged with this therapist, which is why ending it like this is particularly painful and confusing. I made a lot of progress on myself over those years, and I can't help but question every conversation we had now. My stomach has been in knots, and my anxiety has kicked up a few notches. Something I have worked tremendously hard to get under control.

What's worse is this was also my wife's therapist, and she was ghosted at the same time. She has a history of being treated poorly by authority figures and viewed the therapist as a supportive coach/confidant. She opened up to this person and is extremely hurt.

I am ok being ghosted, people do weird crap and I will get over it. But there is no way something culty isn't going on over there. I always viewed the therapist as very good. There were times when some extremely fringe and alternative therapies would be talked about, but I'm an idea guy and figured to each their own. It never really bothered me. I used my time with the therapist as a sounding board and mirror of sorts to work through my issues.

In the end, I know I won't get closure, and I now believe the way the therapist ended the relationship was done with intentional malice, which again makes no sense and has caused quite a bit of inner turmoil for me. I hope writing this down will help my wife and me process what's going on.

I'm posting on behalf of my wife who does not have Reddit but given me permission to help her seek new opportunities. She is a licensed MFT in Wisconsin and currently works as a W2 employee at a large EAP firm. We live in Minnesota, but when we moved, the state didn’t grant her reciprocity. She’s likely approaching the experience where that requirement could be waived, but for now, she remains licensed in WI.

When she started at her current firm, the expectation was to have 24 client openings per week. However, as the company has grown, so have their goals. She’s now required to have 30 openings, meaning she has six 50-minute client sessions every day. She’s a wonderful therapist, empathic, and specializes in trauma, which unfortunately makes this workload unsustainable. She consistently exceeds the firm’s performance metrics, but the emotional toll is leading to burnout. She does have her own therapist.

I firmly believe this is the right career path for her, but the current structure isn’t allowing her to provide the best care to her clients and maintain her own well-being. We have 2 children 5 and under which doesn't help with the exhaustion. I’ve been trying to help by looking for other 100% remote EAP firms but have found that most only offer 1099 positions.  
  
I stumbled upon this subreddit and was hoping the people here could provide some guidance. Ideally, she could find a W2 opportunity that offers a more manageable caseload while allowing her to continue doing what she loves.

Does anyone know of any fully remote EAP firms that hire mental health therapists as W2 employees? Any leads or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

reddit,1jq35ev,therapy,2025-04-03 04:56:32,Partner seeing same therapist,"My partner and I were seeing a couples therapist who started seeing me at the same time for individual trauma work (I know, it's weird). I've since left her and got myself a different individual therapist, who is wonderful, but I am struggling with a kind of grief at having to leave the old therapist. We actually connected really well and I opened up to her and trusted her a lot early on, but the change between individual and couples sessions became quite upsetting and triggering for me. 

However, my partner is still seeing her for individual work. They have started trauma processing sessions together, the same as I was previously doing with her.

I just have such a strange mix of feelings about this. If it helps my partner, I want to be supportive of these sessions. But I also feel this mix of intense sadness, anger and jealousy that they get to do these sessions with her while I don't (even though I made the decision to go elsewhere for my mental health). I worry they're talking about me in negative ways, which wouldn't bother me if my partner was seeing someone who didn't know me. Everyone needs a vent sometimes. But this therapist is a person who I have opened up to about deeply personal childhood things that I've never told anyone else. The thought of getting criticised by her, or him telling her unflattering things about me, is so painful.

Early on, my partner said they spent a session talking mainly about my mental health, and it kills me I wasn't in the room for that and don't know what was discussed (even though hearing that would also likely have been upsetting).

Do you have any advice on coping with these feelings? My partner is genuinely a great person, and I'm not worried about him being malicious in any way. I also don't think it's fair to ask him to stop going if the sessions are helpful. The situation just brings up these intense feelings in me, and I can't stop worrying about what they're talking about.

It's hard to know how much of my response to this is ""normal"", and how much is being driven by my trauma/abandonment wound.

Got diagnosed with bad gingivitis but I’m under the impression that I have a serious form of gum disease after speaking with verified dentists on here after examining and looking at my X-rays. 

All the signs are there and I’m sure I was misdiagnosed when I visited the dentist and am now going through a bad depressive episode. I’ve gone through many of these and came out fine/stronger/more confident but this one is different considering what I have is chronic and there’s no cure for advanced gum disease. It’s literally eating me alive 

I got a regular cleaning and all the symptoms went away but just knowing the disease is there still and will do more damage if I don’t be careful is killing me. I was on such a health kick for about 4-5 months before this and now I’m so depressed I don’t even go to the gym since I found out what’s going on. I was doing so good with working a lot, saving money, and was happy to be at work or the gym because I felt so high on life .

reddit,1jpzp2g,therapy,2025-04-03 02:30:03,I Think I Need Help..,"Hello. I'm 16, I have autism and PTSD among other conditions which I think could be contributing to my issues but I'm not sure.

I opened up for the first time today to the teaching assistant in my class at school. We'll call her E, she's so nice and I trust her so much.
Since I was six, I've fantasised about all sorts of pain, death, torture, crime.
When I was eight, I got pissed off at one of the six year olds in my school and went to stab him with a smashed bottle end, only to be followed by their much older sibling and stabbed myself instead.

I was arrested about nine months ago as I went towards my mother threatening her with a knife and threatening to slash her throat.
I was punching her and really hurting her, however, I wasn't charged with anything.

I've ran over a mouse before with my bike and then dissected it with some scalpels from my suture kit set to take out its heart.
I've wanted to be a doctor since I was two. When I told my teacher about it on a career day when I was seven, she said ""You'll end up in prison before you can even think about medical school."" I was told by numerous teachers that I ""wouldn't make it to seventeen without being arrested."" They were right.
I've been arrested three times that I can recall so far.

I showed E my drawings in one of my sketchbooks. They're mainly stick figures shooting each other, tying each other up.
My therapist (I've known her for six years), doesn't think there's anything wrong with me. She thinks I say stuff for attention - personally, I think ive manipulated her so much over the past six years, she doesn't know me anymore.
I slapped my mother again three weeks ago and I was kicked out and put into care again.

I barely ever feel emotion. I feel I just fake what society wants me to fake. I never cry when I'm alone, never have. I never feel anything.
I just follow what I THINK people would do.
Maybe that's why it was so hard to diagnose me with autism? I got diagnosed at eleven but it took them three years to do the full process.

Im just so confused about myself.
I imagine some pretty horrific stuff, things I'm not sure I can even say online.

Im also heavily addicted to three things: Pain, P*rn & Online Videos of people being hurt and killed.

I've seen so many s*cide and m*rder videos online and have so many saved to my phone.
The one thing I can't watch? Animals being hurt.
I can dissect already dead ones, i just can't watch one being hurt or killed.

I only told E about the fantasies I imagine, not the addictions - im not ready for that yet. I've only known her three months.
I don't expect many of you to have advice but I can't get a new therapist and I don't know what to do to deal with all this.
I spent the last hour of my day in an ICT lesson today stabbing an apple that I'd drawn on to look like a child.
I know there's something wrong with me, I just don't know what and I don't know how to stop it.",I Think I Need Help Hello I m 16 I have autism and PTSD among other conditions which I think could be contributing to my issues but I m not sure I opened up for the first time today to the teaching assistant in my class at school We ll call her E she s so nice and I trust her so much Since I was six I ve fantasised about all sorts of pain death torture crime When I was eight I got pissed off at one of the six year olds in my school and went to stab him with a smashed bottle end only to be followed by their much older sibling and stabbed myself instead I was arrested about nine months ago as I went towards my mother threatening her with a knife and threatening to slash her throat I was punching her and really hurting her however I wasn t charged with anything I ve ran over a mouse before with my bike and then dissected it with some scalpels from my suture kit set to take out its heart I ve wanted to be a doctor since I was two When I told my teacher about it on a career day when I was seven she said You ll end up in prison before you can even think about medical school I was told by numerous teachers that I wouldn t make it to seventeen without being arrested They were right I ve been arrested three times that I can recall so far I showed E my drawings in one of my sketchbooks They re mainly stick figures shooting each other tying each other up My therapist I ve known her for six years doesn t think there s anything wrong with me She thinks I say stuff for attention personally I think ive manipulated her so much over the past six years she doesn t know me anymore I slapped my mother again three weeks ago and I was kicked out and put into care again I barely ever feel emotion I feel I just fake what society wants me to fake I never cry when I m alone never have I never feel anything I just follow what I THINK people would do Maybe that s why it was so hard to diagnose me with autism I got diagnosed at eleven but it took them three years to do the full process Im just so confused about myself I imagine some pretty horrific stuff things I m not sure I can even say online Im also heavily addicted to three things Pain P rn Online Videos of people being hurt and killed I ve seen so many s cide and m rder videos online and have so many saved to my phone The one thing I can t watch Animals being hurt I can dissect already dead ones i just can t watch one being hurt or killed I only told E about the fantasies I imagine not the addictions im not ready for that yet I ve only known her three months I don t expect many of you to have advice but I can t get a new therapist and I don t know what to do to deal with all this I spent the last hour of my day in an ICT lesson today stabbing an apple that I d drawn on to look like a child I know there s something wrong with me I just don t know what and I don t know how to stop it,2,0,my class at school,IrishMound,https://reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jpzp2g/i_think_i_need_help/,-0.9989,-0.04457398661944116,Low,Negative

I’ve brought up this up to her and she’s told me that you can , by practicing skills .  I feel like when I push back or try , she pushes back and I just feel small and invalidated .

I just don’t know what to do , because a huge ass part of this is my forking environment and being in a fascist country . I know those things to be true and they aren’t excuses . They ARE my reality . To me it feels like she sees me using them as excuses and avoidance .

reddit,1jpy35p,therapy,2025-04-03 01:24:29,What is considered normal/okay for therapists cancelling sessions?,"For context I have been seeing a therapist since December of last year so about 4.5 months. In late February she told me at the end of one of my sessions that she was going to be gone on vacation for two weeks. I signed up for weekly appointments for context it's in the treatment plan that I signed.

Well two weeks became three weeks and in the end I only had one therapy session in March. Then at the end of that one session I had in March I was told that she wouldn't be able to see me for another two weeks due to ""scheduling conflicts"". This means that once again I will only have one therapy session this month because I will be out of town at the very end of April through the start of May. 

I'm autistic so I have trouble figuring out how to address issues like these. I will be seeing a psychiatrist next week for a one time consult due to my depression being so bad and I can't seem to find a medication that works for it.

Am I being overly sensitive about the lack of sessions? I've never had a therapist cancel sessions so frequently. That being said my therapist is the only one in the state that I live in that really understands adult autism and how it affects women.

reddit,1jptumx,therapy,2025-04-02 22:37:11,My mom basically ruined therapy for me and it made me lose trust in therapy/counseling,"I use to see a counselor who seemed okay at first. But he did not seem to realize how mean my mom was because she lied so much and was good at pretending to care about me when she went to the counseling sessions with me. (She loved overriding me and also just wanted to know what I talked about with the counselor cause she didn't allow me to have privacy even after I turned 18. She was always an authoritarian ""my house my rules"" kind of person even when a lot of her rules were unreasonable.) The counselor believed me about my step dad but he didn't believe me about my mom cause she was so good at pretending to care. (She didn't care. She just pretended to care so she can keep trying to frame me as mentally ill because she does not believe me about all of the physical abuse I faced from my step dad.)

There also came a point where my parents eventually kept talking about how they wanted to kick me out. Well, I could not afford to move out properly cause most of my money was used to help them pay their bills. When I told my counselor about that situation he thought that they were only saying they want to kick me out to scare me and that they would not be able to afford to kick me out if they needed my help with bills. (He also mentioned that some parents charge their kids rent and then give their kids the rent money back when they move out but I told him that I knew my parents were not going to give me back the money and that they wanted my money for themelves) But then later on my step dad threatened to beat me up and then he kicked me out of the house and they watched me pack my outfits. I guess my counselour thought that my parents were not the type of people who would kick their kid out if they took their kid to counseling. 

It kind of reminds me of how some people claim that marriage therapy does not work for people in abusive marriages. Or abusive relationships. They say the abuser is often good at manipulating the therapist OR the therapist eventually refuses to continue the couples/marriage therapy because they don't want to encourage an abusive relationship. 

When I was a kid she also took me to other therapists and counselors who all told her I was normal until she finally found one who agreed with her. Some of them told her I might have ADHD but she kept trying to tell the counselors that she thinks I had more than that and kept changing my counselor over and over until she found one who believed her lies. 

She also convinced the shelter workers that I ""hallucinated that she wouldn't let me back"" even though she made it clear that she wouldn't let me back. They asked her ""Can she stay with you?"" And she said ""I will make arrangements"" without clarifying what those arrangements were. She actually meant arrangments for a hotel. (I know cause she told me that and she also rented me a hotel after that) and when I spoke to the shelter workers again about it they called my mom again to fix the misunderatanding. It actually pissed me off that she had no problem being vague when they ask if I can live with her. (Because she knows if she flat out said no it would make her look bad and make it seem like she spoke to the shelter workers for nothing.) But she had no problem spending an hour tellling them she thinks I am crazy while pretending to care about me. She just wanted information about me she didn't actually care. 

I am not homeless anymore. But I am still bitter about the situation. One of the other shelter workers also looked at me like a completely different person after speaking to my mom. But the other one who my mom fixed the misunderstanding with actually felt bad about the misunderstanding later. 

Also to be clear, I have never been on drugs and never been to jail. My mom just wanted to frame me as mentally ill so she can use it as an excuse to not believe me about my abusive step dad. And also so she can use it as an excuse for letting her husband kick me out. So she can say i desrved it for being mentally ill and that ""they tried to help me"" with counseling before they kicked me out.

reddit,1jpth5r,therapy,2025-04-02 22:22:17,Is it normal to struggle this much to find a therapist?,"I've had 6 different therapists so far. Only one of them worked, and I've had appalling experiences that seriously makes me question what kind of people decide to be psychologists. Here's some actual things that happened:

\- I'm bipolar, diagnosed when I was 16 (I was 30 at the time this happened). One therapist with over 20 years of experience told me she didn't think I was bipolar and wanted to help me question the diagnosis and all it would take is a blood test because bipolar is caused by a lack of lithium in the brain. I was absolutely horrified when I heard this. First, doesn't it occur to this lady that if diagnosing bipolar disorder is that simple then maybe one of the dozens of doctors I've seen would have thought about that blood test? And that those doctors are actual doctors with a medicine degree, whereas she is not? Also I spent years denying my diagnosis, not being medicated, skipping my doctor's appointments, and when I started therapy with her I had already accepted my illness and was complying with treatment, and she decided she wanted to question my diagnosis without even asking me if I wanted to?

\- Another one butted heads with me because I was 30 and didn't have a driver's license. I was 30, living alone and financially independent since I was 20, had a stable job that paid above average, had just bought my house all alone, fully autonomous and independent, while most people that age can't even afford to move out of their parents', but this lady thought I wasn't a proper adult if I didn't drive. I swear we spent a good 10 minutes going back and forth with her questioning why I didn't drive and don't I want to drive and do you think it's normal for a 30 year old not to drive and it ended up with me telling her in no uncertain terms ""I'm not getting my driver's license"" to which she replied ""hmmm"". She was generally lacking in empathy and understanding too.

\- Another one was always 10-15 minutes late to our sessions. Our sessions were supposed to be 1 hour, but they were always 45 - 50 minutes. Let's say we were schedule to start at 4PM, and she only showed up at 4:10 - 4:15. When I once complained that she's always late she answered that she sees people who are in a crisis and she can't just walk away from people who are having a crying fit. Apparently ever single patient before me was in a crisis, and having crying fits. Lucky for her, I was the picture of health and never had any crisis that would delay her next session.

\- Another therapist, when I complained how my (adult) (now ex) boyfriend does nothing at home, she said I need to ask him to do things, help him to do them, and praise them when he does.

Another one I felt she was just lacking in compassion and I felt judged. There was only one therapist who was generally sympathetic, made me feel secure enough that I told him a bunch of stuff from my past that I had never told anyone, and was genuinely helpful. Still, he was very forgetful and forgot whole parts of my story that I had told him - I had to tell him multiple times that my parents are divorced, I have two sibling, my mom was depressed when I was born, and we did my family tree three times because he forgot we had already done it.

Is it just me? Or am I just having bad luck?",Is it normal to struggle this much to find a therapist I ve had 6 different therapists so far Only one of them worked and I ve had appalling experiences that seriously makes me question what kind of people decide to be psychologists Here s some actual things that happened I m bipolar diagnosed when I was 16 I was 30 at the time this happened One therapist with over 20 years of experience told me she didn t think I was bipolar and wanted to help me question the diagnosis and all it would take is a blood test because bipolar is caused by a lack of lithium in the brain I was absolutely horrified when I heard this First doesn t it occur to this lady that if diagnosing bipolar disorder is that simple then maybe one of the dozens of doctors I ve seen would have thought about that blood test And that those doctors are actual doctors with a medicine degree whereas she is not Also I spent years denying my diagnosis not being medicated skipping my doctor s appointments and when I started therapy with her I had already accepted my illness and was complying with treatment and she decided she wanted to question my diagnosis without even asking me if I wanted to Another one butted heads with me because I was 30 and didn t have a driver s license I was 30 living alone and financially independent since I was 20 had a stable job that paid above average had just bought my house all alone fully autonomous and independent while most people that age can t even afford to move out of their parents but this lady thought I wasn t a proper adult if I didn t drive I swear we spent a good 10 minutes going back and forth with her questioning why I didn t drive and don t I want to drive and do you think it s normal for a 30 year old not to drive and it ended up with me telling her in no uncertain terms I m not getting my driver s license to which she replied hmmm She was generally lacking in empathy and understanding too Another one was always 10 15 minutes late to our sessions Our sessions were supposed to be 1 hour but they were always 45 50 minutes Let s say we were schedule to start at 4PM and she only showed up at 4 10 4 15 When I once complained that she s always late she answered that she sees people who are in a crisis and she can t just walk away from people who are having a crying fit Apparently ever single patient before me was in a crisis and having crying fits Lucky for her I was the picture of health and never had any crisis that would delay her next session Another therapist when I complained how my adult now ex boyfriend does nothing at home she said I need to ask him to do things help him to do them and praise them when he does Another one I felt she was just lacking in compassion and I felt judged There was only one therapist who was generally sympathetic made me feel secure enough that I told him a bunch of stuff from my past that I had never told anyone and was genuinely helpful Still he was very forgetful and forgot whole parts of my story that I had told him I had to tell him multiple times that my parents are divorced I have two sibling my mom was depressed when I was born and we did my family tree three times because he forgot we had already done it Is it just me Or am I just having bad luck,0,23,the brain,MoonInAries17,https://reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jpth5r/is_it_normal_to_struggle_this_much_to_find_a/,-0.744,0.04114845938375351,Low,Negative

My brother was raped by a male family member when he was a child. It shook our entire world and destroyed my Mom. My mom contacted the authorities as soon as she found out and started my brother in therapy. Granted, this was in 1997. Therapy has come a long way.

My brother's wife is against therapy and pretty much says that what happened is common and its just another hardship in life and basically to 'let it go'. My Mom used to check in with my brother every couple of years regarding the situation, just to make sure he was ok. That has since stopped since his wife doesnt believe in 'bringing up the past'.

reddit,1jpl8x4,therapy,2025-04-02 15:53:57,Therapist leaving... again,"Therapist leaving... again

Tldr; I found out that I'm losing my new therapist, shortly after losing my long term therapist just a few months ago, and a long history of abrupt loss of care and compounded abandonment trauma, and I'm on the verge of crashing out. 

I've made a few posts already on this subject in this and another therapy sub, which are still up (can't link in this sub but i don't post often so they should be easy to find on my page), if you want my original thoughts on this. But the gist of the issue is this:

I lost my long term therapist in January. I had been seeing him for over 2 years. He was the only therapist I've ever truly connected with. I have a really hard time being comfortable opening up with people, it took a long time for us to get there. We delved into trauma processing therapy, including EMDR and narrative processing (formally diagnosed with PTSD). We still had a lot to work through, as I have extensive trauma related to abuse, sexual abuse, neglect and abandonment and it took a long time before I was capable of talking about these issues with him. There's still quite a bit that I hadn't even been able to tell him at all yet.

His leaving was not by choice, he was blindsided by the clinic in December about not renewing his contract in the new year. Which meant he was not able to give me much notice, we only had 3 sessions after finding this out. (he had previously assured me he had no intention of ending my care anytime soon and that if it became necessary the process would be handled delicately and would spend several seasons preparing me for it and making sure I found care with someone else first). This was extremely emotional for me, I became very disregulated and emotionally shut down.

I have a history of abandonment and neglect in my childhood, and I've experienced the sudden loss of care providers several times already. This was the third time I've had care from a therapist abruptly end in a way that made me feel extremely vulnerable and like I had no control over what happens to me. Every therapy relationship I've ever had has ended like this. I also had similar abrumpt endings with three different primary care doctors. I've experienced multiple times trying to find mental health care but found that clinics either never answered their phone, wouldn't call back, or were all full. I spent years feeling like I was falling through the cracks in the system before I finally got in to this one. 

Before he left, my therapist connected me with another colleague at the clinic who had been there for years, who he felt would be a good fit for me. He recognized that this was a major trauma trigger for me and that the experience was very damaging.

I started seeing this new therapist in January. This was going okay, but I was obviously still very fragile. I liked her, but I struggled a lot feeling comfortable opening up with her. This is something I talked about with my previous therapist a lot in our last sessions, feeling like I was not going to be able to trust a new therapist again enough to open up, because I would be too afraid of the emotional fall out I would experience when they eventually left. 

The therapy wasn't unbenificial, but we were still mostly focusing on shallow issues, with me also filling her in about my family history and some of the trauma that is a bit easier to talk about. No real trauma processing yet. Then in February she had to cancel an appointment last minute, and told me she would contact me when she was able to return to work to reschedule. I was mostly okay with this but it did make me a little nervous.

After that I didn't hear back from her at all for 3 more weeks. This was a major trigger for me, I had an intense depressive episode, especialy as i had not been told how long this was going to be. At one point I found out she had already come back (I don't know when) but she hadnt contacted me yet. I know logically this wasn't likely on purpose, but it was still triggering and made me feel more cautious about trusting her. I had a major fear that I was falling through the cracks in the system again. I made a post about it on here, but I finally heard back from her a few days after making it.

 I started seeing her again in March. I was still struggling against a need to emotionally protect myself. I was able to open up a little, but it's been hard. The three week absence put me on edge. I had knew a small amount about the reason (family emergency) and I had a feeling that it was going to come back up.Today I found out she is leaving the clinic due to a family emergency, and that she won't be coming back. 

She said it was entirely unexpected and that she would have never committed to my care if she knew that this was going to happen (she was aware of my trauma around abandonment and loss of care going in). I understand that it wasn't intentional, but it never is. That's honestly worse. It reinforces the strong feeling I can't shake that no matter how good or responsible a therapist is, they're still going to be forced to abandon my care. I can't judge how safe I am with them by how stable pr professional they are.

I am honestly so exhausted. I feel so fragile, and it gets worse every time this happens. As soon as she told me, I felt all my walls i had worked on the past few months go right back up. I mentally checked out of the conversation and basically emotionally shut her out and went through the motions for the rest of the conversation until it ended. At this point I don't know how the hell I'm ever supposed to convince myself again that I can be emotionally safe with another therapist.

We have one more session later this week. I don't know when she's leaving, or if she is planning on offering another appointment to me again before she does, or if I would even take it. I agreed to at least meet her for our scheduled appointment, but I'm not really sure what will come from that, I think I'm essentially totally emotionally closed off right now.

She said she is going to set me up with another therapist in the clinic who she thinks would be a good fit. She said she thinks the only reason my last therapist didn't set me up with her before was because her schedule was full. Apparently it still is, but given my situation they want to prioritize getting me care as soon as possible. I don't know yet how soon this can happen or how often she can see me. I'm also skeptical of the quality of care I'll receive from a therapist who is clearly overworked, and concerned that she will also leave (especially if she's already overburdened and possibly burnt out).

I'm honestly so burnt out I don't even know if I want to see this other therapist. I honestly just don't believe it will last anymore. It took me a long time to get to a place where I could trust my last therapist, and this ability was pretty much shattered when he left. I considered quitting therapy all together. I have been trying to maintain a positive outlook with the new one, only for it to happen again. She said that therapist has been at the clinic for a decade, but my last therapist had been there for over 7 years, so what difference does that make? How am I supposed to view any therapist as a safe, stable place to heal knowing that at any moment they can and are likely to abruptly leave??

It's been suggested that I look into private practice, as the therapists there are more stable, but I can't afford that. The clinic I go to specializes in low income care. I'm on Medicade, and sliding scale, plus I qualify for low income grants through the clinic. This means I'm often only paying for very low copays (depending on grant availability) with a very flexible pay schedule. It's frankly not something I think I will find with private practice, and I can barely afford my car and food as it is now. 

I've considered quitting therapy. I know I shouldn't, because I am not in a good place now and I really do need help. I made a lot of progress with my last therapist, but there is still a lot of chaos and lack of control and trauma to process. But k can't take this constant instability and loss of control. I don't know how to move forward from this.

I expressed my pain through the break-up I'm going through during the first session. A week later, during the session I break down after telling her my plans for suicide and my inability to let go of my ex. It got very messy and I think it upset her.

She then says that my issues are beyond her expertise and writes a letter to my GP recommending I see a psychiatrist and says I am in danger of suicide and in danger of hurting my ex (which I would never do). That's okay though, she's just doing her job (and doing it well to be honest!).

Anyway, a week goes by and I'm feeling a bit better, no longer thinking about or planning my death. I try to book another two appointments with her, because I still need to talk and work on my problems and I get a call from the manager of the therapy company saying that I can't see her and instead I can only see male therapists there and also gave me the recommendation to seek out help from external male psychologists. 

I explained that I am more comfortable talking to women about my problems and I might have trouble to open up to a male therapist.

What's going on here? Why would they make this recommendation?

Thanks!

This is going to be a long rant about as title says, everything, Mostly family and religious issues, gender and sexuality issues, gf issues and suicidal ideation, friends, self, and whatever else comes to me in the moment,

My family is very Christian and I’m not, I’m a gender confused bisexual agnostic,Yet they don’t know this, They think I’m a straight, Jesus loving average straight guy, Every Sunday I get dragged to a church that bash people like me a lot and talk about how I’m insane and will go to hell, This of course makes despise going to church, but I’m dragged anyways, my family made me participate in a church event that basically forces you to be involved with the church, I hide myself away in my room the entire time I’m at home as I feel uncomfortable being around my family as I have to lie to them and hear them talk bad about things that relate to people I’m close with, my family gets concerned why I don’t spend time with them or why I seem so off but I just lie to them every time and after every time that happens I feel like shit and then tell myself I can be out of here in 3 years

Idk what the hell I am and why I am the way I am, I honestly wish it was simpler, I wish it could just stick with pronouns I wish it could just be a simple thing and not much more, but like it’s not and I hate it, and everyone I talk to thinks I’m gay, everyone in my school thinks I’m gay, and I tell them I’m halfway gay and that’s it, I would be more open if I wasn’t in the Bible Belt but here we are, and I know this is a lot of shit for strangers I will likely never meet again but I don’t care anymore

My entire friend group hates my Girlfriend Everyone hates her for being egotistical, rude , toxic, possessive and easily jealous, apparently she told my friends  some stuff me and her did and that made them all uncomfortable (understandably so) she talked to my ex and asked weird questions about what she did and such and this and I feel like shit and awful , because I still love my girlfriend dearly, she’s so sweet and funny and I care for her deeply, instead of leaving her I want to help her grow and get better but it’s hard when you hear she wants to kill herself and that I’m the only thing keeping her tethered here, I try to help her the best I can everyday but it gets so rough and tired and hard, then my friends also dropped me because I suck at communicating, I said the wrong things and thus I get dropped and then my world fell apart because then who do I have? My world is super fragile and I don’t want to be here anymore, my friends picked me up again but it still feels shitty cause I can just be dropped in a day,  and there’s so much Idk what I have to look forward to anymore, everyone has a drive, a reason to wake up tomorrow and mine are dwindling, what should I look forward to? How should I only look 6 feet around me? How do I know the world end clock won’t strike midnight, how do I know everything in the political world will be ok? How do I know there won’t be a third world war in 5 years, how do I know I will be safe and still have a family to rely on ? How do I know my wanted job won’t be obsolete because of Ai? How do I know things will get better? I just feel so weak and fragile, I feel like I’m being overdramatic about it all and such

reddit,1jpgwkl,therapy,2025-04-02 10:36:41,Did I screw up at work?,"I am a mid level program manager (individual contributor). I report to HQ and my dotted line in the building is the general manager. I use relationship building and influence to get things accomplished in my job because my job relies on others doing what they are trained to do, When I first joined my job a little less than two years ago, I connected with a senior manager whom I thought could potentially end up being a mentor for me. I appreciated his honesty, his ability to kick back and have a real conversation. What I didn’t realize was that in a years time he would have it out for me. 

Over the last year I have been blindsided by this manager with anger and frustration over things that have nothing to do with me, questioned like I’m being interrogated, told that I am failing, that the building is not aligned on recent focuses that have been communicated in relation to my role and told that I need to be “driving” change. I’ve been told that the work I’ve been doing is not what I should be focused on and instead my focus should be on the senior leadership team. I’ve told him more than once that the way he approaches me is overwhelming and that if he going to criticize my work, I would appreciate help to create an action plan that will help me meet his expectations and his response on multiple occasions has been that it’s my job and I need to figure it out. I always leave feeling like crap. Like a failure and even more confused than I was before. This guy has a history of being disrespectful and aggressive at other buildings within my organization. I know that what I’m sharing doesn’t seem extreme but it’s hard to articulate the intimidation, confusion and control I suffer through with him.

I don’t report to him but he still feels the need to tell that I am failing at my job. I’ve not received this feedback from anyone else. My annual review was great and I received a raise. 

During our most recent meeting he told me I need to be in my general managers office making him aware that his senior leadership team is not aligned to focuses and they don’t care and something needs to change. I don’t agree though. I think we have opportunities but for the most part I believe we are headed in the right direction. 

I feel these interactions with this person is meant to make me feel isolated. He rips me apart behind closed doors and when I stop talking he wraps the meeting up with a nice little bow and then tries to ask me stupid questions like “do you do xyz this weekend?” To try and reconnect. It makes me feel like I’m in an abusive relationship. 

I recently snapped and shared all of this with another senior manager whom I am closest to and I also inadvertently threw this guy under the bus by calling him out and telling them how he told me I need to be lighting them all up in the general managers office. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. It was making me feel so paranoid like everyone at work feels the same way he does and I felt more alone than ever. I wasn’t bad mouthing him, I just needed someone else to know how I had been feeling and how I felt like I was being targeted by this guy. 

I’m terrified that it’s going to come back to haunt me that I shared this information. I had been keeping my direct boss in the loop with all of the interactions I had been having over the last year so I know I’m covered from that end but I had kept everyone else out of it until now. It had been weighing so heavy on me lately that I had to start taking sleep medication again. I’m dealing with such terrible anxiety and hopelessness that it won’t get better or im going to get fired or something. 

Did I screw up by speaking up? And why do I feel guilty about him possibly getting in trouble?

reddit,1jpgk2k,therapy,2025-04-02 10:14:02,therapist threatened to stop my treatment if I don´t cooperate,"I (f 22) have had a tough time the past 10 months. I had to cut contact to a couple family members and moved out of a multigenerational house to my first own place last fall. I was already suffering from depression bevor I moved out but the stress made it much worse. I went to a day treatment program for 12 weeks and came back with a couple new diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, more specifically the so called ""Quiet BPD"" where the patient doesn´t show it as much but is suffering just as badly on the inside. Apparently it´s very underdiagnosed. 

I´ve also been suffering from a mild eating disorder for many years. It´s undiagnosed so far and it doesn´t match any specified ED diagnosis, i guess it´s a mix of different disorders. It´s not lifethreatening at all, I´m just struggling with the disordered thoughts on a daily basis. I have always had a normal weight. I´ve never told anyone before, as i thought i would have to be severely underweight. I was also in denial if i´m being honest. I could deal with it on my own most of the time, I was never in any real danger and I somehow managed to recover every now and then for a couple months or a year before it came back but at least I´ve been working AGAINST the ED and not with it. If that´s worth anything.

Background information: I tried to tell a different therapist about it a couple years ago and she told me it´s not necessary to work on it if my weight is stable and normal. So I wasn´t diagnosed or given any help or advice. When I was in the mental hospital 4 years ago I tried again and the therapist said:""Trust me, you don´t wanna have anorexia. It´s a nightmare to treat, the patients don´t wanna get better."" It was dismissed and I wasn´t believed because again, I had a normal weight.

My regular therapist has been suspecting it before but i was denying everything. TBH i straight up lied to her face. She didn´t bring it up again after a few times because i obviously didn´t wanna talk about it. I didn´t lie on purpose, i think i was genuinely convinced I didn´t have a problem worth mentioning. I know that´s sick thinking. When I came back from treatment last week I straight up told her I lied the last time I saw her. I also told her why. She told me she already knew (of course) and seeing the BPD diagnosis now it makes sense. Apparently people with BPD lie a lot..? Idk. She was very mad and judgy, but I get it. I told her that the reason i´m telling her now is i´m feeling better overall and i really wanna work on the ED now. It took me years to be able admit it to myself in my own journal that i have a problem.  I don´t know if it makes any sense but I was too scared to tell a very slim very beautiful therapist about it and then be dismissed again. I thought if I hear I´m basically not thin enough to get help, I´m gonna lose my shit. 

Anyways, she told me we only have 8 sessions left before she needs to apply for ""longtime treatment"" for me and she isn´t completely sure she wants to do that with me if i´m lying to her. Fair enough. I told her honestly the only time i´ve lied was when she rightfully accused me of the ED but i was convinced i didn´t have one. She is very direct and can be confronting as hell, and i think my BPD is allergic to that. Makes me lose my mind, my brain always thinks she hates me if she´s giving me tough love. 

In the day treatment program the male therapist said we only have to work on things if i WANT to work on them. Obviously if i don´t see a problem or i´m not ready he can´t force me. My regular therapist acts like we don´t have a choice other than work on the ED. I want to, i´m just wondering why she´s so demanding. She said the only way we can do this is if i´m seeing a doctor and get weight-checked regularly. I´m also gonna do a food protocoll so they can see what i´m eating on a reagular basis. She ""threatened"" me a couple times if i´m lying again she´s not gonna continue working with me. I started crying 10 minutes before the session ended and kept crying while me made the new appointment and on the way back to my car. I´ve explained multiple times i didn´t lie on purpose, i´m sorry and i´ve now come clean on my own intention. Isn´t that worth anything? I feel like a criminal now and the BPD is telling me everyone hates me. I´m seeing my doctor today and i´m doing all my therapy homework. I´m wondering, is she just giving me tough love for the purpose of getting me to a doctor? Is she purposely being a little ""mean"" so I actually do what´s best for my health? I get how tiring it must be fighting with someone who´s sick if they´re sick or not. The only excuse I can give is that it´s probably a part of my issue that i don´t ever think i actually am sick or need help.

Any thoughts or advice?

Yes, I don't cut myself. And neither do I want to commit suicide. But what do I do instead?

- I turn down opportunities just for the sake of it

- I can't seem to comprehend the idea of consequences at all, I act on whims and impulses and cant get myself to gaf about the aftermath. Even when the consequences get to me, I just accept them and I never feel like I should change anything about my ways

- I avoid sleeping for no reason, until I'm completely exhausted. I fluctuate between overeating and not eating at all. 

-I either groom myself obsessively or don't do it at all for days, and that includes showering and brushing my teeth 

-TW i never consciously think about self harming, but when I have a potential weapon in my hand, I cant help but make myself bleed somehow. For example, I have a thing for removing dead skin from my feet, elbows, my cuticles, or even where it's not necessary with this small sharp blade for calluses, and I always end up giving myself raw, bleeding wounds that turn into infections

-I get so close to achieving something and then I deliberately ruin it. In fact, I recently finished a marketing course and all I had to do was come up with a product idea and make it into a small project (which counts as the exam) to get my certificate and I just didn't do it. It wasnt even procrastination at this point, I just didnt want to do this good thing for myself

-I spend my whole day scrolling, and its not even an uncontrollable addiction, I literally do it on purpose because I know that even if I put all distractions away, I wont do anything productive, I'll just stare at the ceiling. Why would I want to do something nice for myself if I hate myself?

And the cherry on top is that I afford to do all this because my parents financially support me (I recently turned 20), so I live more comfortably then I ever did now, and I have my own apartment. I dont have many friends to enjoy it with though.. what a surprise. 

I know it probably has to do with the fact that until 2 years ago, I lived a very tumultuous life, a mix of traumatic events and great life achievements(they didn't bring me satisfaction at all, probably subsided by the emotional turmoil), always without a damn break. Im only 20 and feel like a shell of a human with the worst coping mechanisms and the emotional regulation of a toddler. I dissociate heavily. 

Now, I'm not even sure what I'm looking for by posting this. Maybe just to get it off my chest, or to get some answers to my paradoxical questions. How am I supposed to help myself if I dont love myself enough to feel deserving of that help? How can I take steps to better myself, if my self hatred stops me from it?

My back and arms hurt, and it makes me incredibly anxious because I keep fearing it’s a heart attack. My dad recently had a stroke—he’s okay now—but the experience left me traumatized.

I’ve been avoiding sugar since we believe it contributed to his stroke. Now, every pain I feel, I immediately associate with a life-threatening illness. I’m exhausted from living like this. Even though I try to focus on positive things and redirect my mind, I often fail and fall back into anxiety.

I suspect that a big part of this stress comes from my job, which doesn’t provide financial stability. The thought of getting seriously ill and not being able to afford medical care terrifies me. More than anything, I just want to enjoy life, do what I love, and free myself from fear and anxiety. I’m willing to put in the work to overcome this. 

Do you have any tips on how I can distract myself or set daily goals to shift my focus away from anxiety? I truly believe in the power of the mind, but once anxiety takes over, it feels impossible to convince myself that I’ll be okay. Right now, it feels stronger than me, and I know I’m missing out on important things because of it. What can I do?

Our intake session and the second one felt semi-unfocused, and she didn’t ask me many direct Q&A questions about my background. No informed consent/confidentiality discussion. 

In our second session, she was a bit distracted by her pet in the room for the first ten minutes. 

About 30 mins in to the session she says I might need to consider an intensive outpatient program. 

She said “you aren’t where you should be at this age at all.” Her tone felt judgmental, very direct, and slightly harsh. It’s true, but that’s partially why I’m seeking treatment. Then, she asked if I’ve ever had developmental delays growing up, (I didn’t), and that question made me feel bad.

I’m 30, never learned to drive from anxiety (drove a little as a teen and did driver’s ed then quit), live with parents (one had major, life threatening health issue some years ago), and I mentioned I’m embarrassed that I don’t do any real cooking at all anymore since I got very sick with GI issues in my early twenties. Haven’t worked full time in a couple years but have been applying to some jobs this year. I also have other health issues and embarrassing symptoms. 

She said I’m in a major depression and have severe anxiety, might have OCD and some PTSD. She immediately said “that’s obsessive” after I only mentioned one thing about thinking I only have a set number of years left with someone as their birthday approaches. 

I have another session scheduled this week but not sure how long I should stick with her before potentially moving on.

reddit,1jp7ah9,therapy,2025-04-02 02:53:04,Would therapy help and why is my brain messed up?,"Hi everyone. This story is a little everywhere. I honestly don’t want people I know to see this, because I feel like a total loser.

Back in may of 2024 I went to a carnival/fair with a friend of mine. We knew nothing about this event because our parents had told us to wait till we were 15. 
I was very excited and nervous but figured we’d be fine. My friend had bought some alcohol from a random man who didn’t care about our age and we started drinking. 
I’m not talking about mild alcohol or something like that. We were drinking full on vodka, tequila etc. 
Obviously none of us had really been drunk before so I quickly hit us. We were approached by some men in there twenties (they were nice dw) and they asked us how we (two underage girls) had managed to get alcohol and when we told them how, they just shook their head and left pretty much. 

We drink some more, since we didn’t think we were drunk enough and leave to go to a different place. Now everything from here is blurry to me, so I’ll try my best to explain what happened.

Apparently we met some men in their thirties and things turn romantic. My friend said that I was fully making out with him, which I remember to a degree but she’s said that it was long and we started touching one another, which I don’t remember at all. 
They leave again and we were alone. We apparently hung out for a while and then I had to pee (I remember this). I asked her if we should go together but she advised me to go alone which I did.
I do also remember meeting a group of guys close to a nearby forest and I remember being asked by one of them to pee together, but I don’t remember anything else. 

According to my friend I returned after a while and I was acting very weird. She had found another group that helped me to feel better. 
I don’t even remember my mom being called and us leaving around 11 pm. 
The next month I felt awful. It started out as a bad hangover but then afterwards I became sick (throwing up, headaches etc.)

Then my period is late and Idk why but I think I might be pregnant. I call my friend and we talk about it. She basically just laughed at me tbh.

Anyways my period finally comes after being 68 days late and I figure I wasn’t pregnant at all. 
Then summer comes which for whatever reason is hard. At the end of August I start having this vision (don’t know what to call it besides that) of my giving a blowjob to one of the men from the group. It was so realistic I could even taste his semen in my mouth. This vision has been bothering me ever since and to make matters more complicated, a vision of him fingering me came a month later.

I think there might be something wrong with me because I have no idea why I suddenly get these visions to the point where they are also in my dreams and obviously constantly in my head. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I think therapy might help but how can I even explain this story when I don’t remember half of it.

reddit,1jp6ylb,therapy,2025-04-02 02:39:23,"Leaving a ""Good Enough"" Marriage-Looking for Insight, Not Judgment","I'm in the middle of separating and likely divorcing my wife of several years. We have two very young kids. From the outside, our life looked solid—no major fights, shared responsibilities, a stable routine. But beneath that, things were quietly broken for a long time.

I’ve struggled for years with the feeling that I was never truly in love with my wife—not in the romantic or erotic sense. I admired her, respected her, and we built a life together. I told myself love would grow through time and shared experience. And in some ways, it did. But the part of me that longed for desire, intimacy, and emotional resonance never really came alive in our relationship.

A month before I proposed to her, she cheated on me. I didn’t find out until later in our marriage. And even more recently, I found out that she never broke contact with that person. She kept him in her life—quietly—in the background, for years. That revelation hit hard. I’m not bringing it up to deflect from my own failures, but to give context: this has been a marriage full of misalignment and emotional distance, and both of us played a role.

For my part, I coped in toxic ways. I fell into porn, casual hookups, even paid sex. I was unfaithful—often emotionally shut down and dishonest. I hated myself for it. When I recently fell in love with someone else, it cracked everything open. She didn’t cause the divorce, but she made it impossible to keep pretending. For the first time, I felt real love, real connection—and I couldn’t keep lying to myself or my wife anymore.

Now I’m separated, doing couples therapy (to co-parent well, not reconcile), and trying to stay present for my kids from a distance. But it’s incredibly hard. My family is disappointed in me. My dad thinks I should’ve just stayed for the kids. I don't believe they know about my wife's infidelity or the fact that she never emotionally disconnected from the guy she cheated on me with, so I feel they're judging me without the full context of the situation and believe I'm just destroying a beautiful family. Again, they don't see that this has been a marriage full of misalignment and emotional distance, and both of us played a role. They've essentially been giving me the silent treatment, except my dad. He's tried to understand, but is the kind of man that believes in sacrificing one's own happiness for the greater good of keeping the family together. Sometimes I wonder if they’re right. Sometimes I think maybe I should have just learned to live with “good enough” and find joy in my kids and the stability of family. 

But I didn’t want to just survive marriage. I wanted to feel alive in it.

I’m in therapy. I’m trying to build a life rooted in truth instead of performance. But I’m haunted by guilt—by shame—by doubt. It’s hard not to feel like the villain in everyone’s eyes. Even when I believe I made the right call, I wonder if I’ve just ruined something beautiful.

Has anyone else been through something like this? Left a seemingly stable marriage for emotional honesty and desire—and wrestled with guilt, doubt, and judgment? Did clarity ever come? Did you ever feel peace again?",Leaving a Good Enough Marriage Looking for Insight Not Judgment I m in the middle of separating and likely divorcing my wife of several years We have two very young kids From the outside our life looked solid no major fights shared responsibilities a stable routine But beneath that things were quietly broken for a long time I ve struggled for years with the feeling that I was never truly in love with my wife not in the romantic or erotic sense I admired her respected her and we built a life together I told myself love would grow through time and shared experience And in some ways it did But the part of me that longed for desire intimacy and emotional resonance never really came alive in our relationship A month before I proposed to her she cheated on me I didn t find out until later in our marriage And even more recently I found out that she never broke contact with that person She kept him in her life quietly in the background for years That revelation hit hard I m not bringing it up to deflect from my own failures but to give context this has been a marriage full of misalignment and emotional distance and both of us played a role For my part I coped in toxic ways I fell into porn casual hookups even paid sex I was unfaithful often emotionally shut down and dishonest I hated myself for it When I recently fell in love with someone else it cracked everything open She didn t cause the divorce but she made it impossible to keep pretending For the first time I felt real love real connection and I couldn t keep lying to myself or my wife anymore Now I m separated doing couples therapy to co parent well not reconcile and trying to stay present for my kids from a distance But it s incredibly hard My family is disappointed in me My dad thinks I should ve just stayed for the kids I don t believe they know about my wife s infidelity or the fact that she never emotionally disconnected from the guy she cheated on me with so I feel they re judging me without the full context of the situation and believe I m just destroying a beautiful family Again they don t see that this has been a marriage full of misalignment and emotional distance and both of us played a role They ve essentially been giving me the silent treatment except my dad He s tried to understand but is the kind of man that believes in sacrificing one s own happiness for the greater good of keeping the family together Sometimes I wonder if they re right Sometimes I think maybe I should have just learned to live with good enough and find joy in my kids and the stability of family But I didn t want to just survive marriage I wanted to feel alive in it I m in therapy I m trying to build a life rooted in truth instead of performance But I m haunted by guilt by shame by doubt It s hard not to feel like the villain in everyone s eyes Even when I believe I made the right call I wonder if I ve just ruined something beautiful Has anyone else been through something like this Left a seemingly stable marriage for emotional honesty and desire and wrestled with guilt doubt and judgment Did clarity ever come Did you ever feel peace again,11,4,the middle of separating and likely divorcing my wife of several years,Low-Break2370,https://reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jp6ylb/leaving_a_good_enough_marriagelooking_for_insight/,0.982,0.1221109088722725,Low,Positive

Sometimes it feels like there isn’t even a way it ties back in to what we’re discussing. I’ve also never even tried to broach anything around politics. I’m just trying to work through my stuff. 

Additionally, a couple of these things I fundamentally disagree with… I haven’t shared this back to them, but it’s really changed my perception of my therapist. I’m not trying to get political, but it’s been around pretty polarizing events in the news. And it’s clear we probably wouldn’t be watching the same network if that makes sense. I’m totally fine having a therapist with a different perspective than me. The things they brought up though don’t feel appropriate nor do they feel like compassionate viewpoints. My jaw kind of dropped with one of the things mentioned. 

I guess my questions are: this is inappropriate, right? Do I address it with them? Am I wrong for changing because of this?

I recently had a surgery done and haven't been able to get a session in but will be doing that soon. Since the last few weeks I've been feeling really frustrated, angry, low and all kinds of things. Maybe cux of my surgery and the recovery but everytime something happens in my life where I struggle or need advice or help I kind of think of what I'll tell my therapist in the next session which idk if it's healthy or no. 

I've been really waiting to get a session in and now I was just thinking as to what this is and if this is normal. 

Last month as well I was facing an issue in with a friend and all i could think was yeah I'll talk to her in the next session about it. Idk why but somehow I feel there'll be something that'll happen and it'll make me fine or maybe she'll say something that'll make me fine and most of the time that doesn't happen.

reddit,1jp24ye,therapy,2025-04-01 23:27:45,I can't tell if my therapist is good or harmful.,"TW: MENTIONS OF S3LF H@RM 

so l've never had any experience with therapy
and this was my first time contacting a
psychologist. it was an online session and she
took the payment before the session started

i started off with saying that I have concentration issues and that I have suicidal thoughts. she then proceeded to ask me about my childhood, my family, financial condition and some questions about what made me feel neglected and all. she asked me about my education and what I wanna do in the future and it led to me talking about how my father has been investing in my education. she started talking about how most fathers in my country don't usually do this for their children and hence he apparently loves me very dearly.

Now what made me feel deeply judged and
kinda uneasy is that she kept telling me how
my dad loves me dearly even though most of
my issues are because of my dad himself. she
said it almost 4-5 times (note: I didn't mention
much or rather didn't get a chance to discuss
what he does that bothers me and ended up
just talking about his devotion towards my
education mostly).

she also told me how I have nothing much going on in my life to be ""this level of
depressed.""' She also proceeded to laugh after
I said that l've always wanted to dissapear
since my childhood but in a painless way (I also mentioned that now I became less scared of going through pain as i continued to grow). She then told me with a smile ""See if you sl!t your wrist, jump from a building or try any other way of k!ll!ng yourself, then it's bound to hurt and hence a stupid thought and a stupid act. More over if your attempt fails then you'll have to go through major embarassment and that's why it's all stupid to do something like that""

This kinda ticked me off because l've always
heard about not saying something as
dismissive as this to a suicidal person but
then again I'm not a doctor so who knows. I
also mentioned about me not being able to
concentrate and she didn't pay much attention
to that. she just talked mostly about my
childhood and my depression and suicidal
thoughts. She gave me few assignments to do
like walking regularly, physical excercise,
journaling and separating rice from pulses
after mixing then together for helping me with
concentration.

i just want to know if this is an okay thing for a
therapy session and whether or not i need to
change my doctor. Though this was our first session. She asked me to see her again after 10-15 days after I've done all the assignments she gave me.

reddit,1jp0v2c,therapy,2025-04-01 22:36:38,EMDR & DISSASOCIATION,"So I recently stopped talk therapy to start EMDR. I have PTSD and it's gotten to an unbearable point in my sex life. I can't engage in sensual intimate activities without throwing up or gagging very VERY noticeably. Even if I am completely fine in my head, it's my bodies natural response at this point and it's been this way for 2 years. I had raging anor3xia which was what I was focusing on, now that I am more stable with that I'd like to work on my PTSD responses. So I started EMDR, well tried to. I showed up to my first appointment and after I told her I struggle with disassociation she said we'd have to wait to do EMDR because if you just disassociate through the whole process it won't work. I feel a little confused because when you look up how to heal disassociation itself, it recommends EMDR. 

Anyway, I started looking into somatic therapy to help me with my disassociation but it's been kind of hard to research. I'm needing to be more present and found that dance or yoga or exercise help. But I am a nanny who works 5 days a week 8-4pm so something that isn't organized by appointments is harder for me to commit to.

I'd love to hear peoples personal experiences in EMDR and somatic therapy! Did EMDR help with disassociation? Is it true that it won't work if I am still disassociating? What does Somatic therapy look like? Or what did it look like for you? I've looked into somatic dance and am leaning towards that or Somatic yoga, I just feel like I don't have enough information to made an educated decision. The therapist who I mentioned before offered to work on the disassociation with me and we've been doing that for only 2 weeks now, but I am worried the talking and therapy homework will be effective enough.

reddit,1jp0a2w,therapy,2025-04-01 22:13:11,Therapist is forcing me to come in once a week,"Hi all, I started therapy 2 months ago. Not my first time having therapy. In the past I’ve done therapy with other therapists every other week, mostly because financially I can’t afford to pay a copay once a week and also because I feel like going once I week, I won’t have as much to share as opposed to going twice a week.

I wanted to restart therapy and found a new therapist who I liked after our first session. When I went to schedule our next session for every other week, he stated he needs to see my once a week to establish a therapeutic relationship, and if I can’t commit to that then perhaps it isnt the right time for me to have therapy. I was a little taken aback, but eventually agreed.

After 2 months, I’ve asked to see him every other week. He insists on keeping the once a week schedule.

How should I go about this? I really can’t continue to afford my copay every week, and I feel like they are just trying to bill my insurance as much as they can. 

I’ve never had this issue with other therapist. The reason I’ve switched therapist is because I’ve only done virtually, and found a therapist to see in person. I like this therapist but feel that they are not flexible.

The first 2 I tried weren't even licensed therapists, they were ""alternative counselors"" which my insurance considered real therapy. That was a joke. They just pushed new age woo woo nonsense on me, knowing I have a lot of religious trauma specifically associated with new age spirituality. The first one tried to tell me it's ok that I struggle with social graces because I'm ""smarter than everyone else,"" and the second one kept pushing me to reconnect with my toxic mother who I went no contact with for numerous legitimate reasons.

Since I had so much trouble finding a competent licensed therapist my insurance would pay for, I went on a freaking waiting list for over a year to see one. And sure, unlike the other ones, she at least listens, but she's always late and rushing through sessions, cutting me off at around the 38 minute mark, when I'm paying for hour long sessions. She has at least taken me seriously about my need for a formal diagnosis. But now the psychiatrist she referred me to isn't answering calls or emails. And I told her my entire life story of trauma over the past several sessions, only for it to be met with ""I'm going to send you a video for breathing exercises.""

Her boyfriend was SA me and my sisters and she knew and when I told her she said I was lying.
